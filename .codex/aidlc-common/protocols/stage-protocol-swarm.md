# Swarm Protocol Module

### Before initial protected prepare

Bolt directories and branches use the selected intent's `bolt-<id8>_<slug>`
identity, where `<id8>` is the same registry UUID suffix as Unit claims. This
isolates same-named Units across parallel intents. Use emitted paths and branch
names, not names reconstructed from Unit slugs. Creation without a registry
UUID refuses; adopt or re-create the intent before Construction. See
[Bolt identity](../../knowledge/aidlc-shared/worktree-info-schema.md#bolt-identity)
for naming and provenance-gated completion of pre-upgrade legacy Bolts.

For protected Code Generation, the approved parent application source must be
committed and reproducible from the selected worktree base before initial
`prepare`. This applies to both legacy autonomous workflows and new checkpoint
workflows; neither autonomy nor relaxed Change Control exempts the source.
Uncommitted framework records are not themselves a reason to commit unrelated
files: the requirement concerns the approved application-source snapshot.

`prepare` performs a read-only preflight for every emitted Unit before creating
the first child worktree. If approved application source is uncommitted, surface
the actionable commit-and-retry error: no child was created by this refusal and
there is no orphan to discard. Ask the human to commit that approved source, or
perform the commit only when explicitly authorized. **Never commit automatically**
to satisfy prepare. Retry with the current Plan Approval evidence after the
source is committed; if the approved source changed, follow the source preflight
remedy. Plan content edits after approval follow Code Generation Step 3's
effective-fence rule; a lowered fence permits continuation without reapproval.
The commit itself never supplies approval.

The skeleton-to-swarm transition includes this explicit commit step: after the
inline skeleton has passed its integrated check and human checkpoint approval,
commit the approved skeleton application source before preparing the parallel
batch. Do not omit it because the skeleton checkpoint or autonomy grant passed.

### Continuing a partially completed batch

On continuation, `next` may emit the batch's full or remaining Unit set. Once
the current checkpoint revision has a recorded native preparation, the engine
omits `resume_existing` and returns the prepared workers to this continuation
path. A narrower emitted set does not by itself request new plans or approval.

For a remaining Unit already prepared in the current attempt, verify its
existing approval in both the parent and its recorded worktree:

```bash
aidlc engine testing-posture verify --unit "<unit>"
aidlc engine testing-posture verify --unit "<unit>" --project-dir "<recorded worktree>"
```

When both checks return `execution_allowed: true` (exit 0), continue with the protected worker brief and preserved
worktree. Skip initial planning, Plan Approval, and `prepare` for that Unit, then
follow the worker/check/reviewer/finalize steps below. Retain the original group
manifest and receipts even when only one member remains. `ok: false` can coexist
with allowed continuation: it truthfully says the current content is not
approved and does not require a new approval stop when execution is allowed.
Use `reason` for the continuation message; `approval_reason` is the detailed
stale binding diagnosis, not a refusal to execute.
A directory's presence
alone is not approval; failed verification requires the named repair with the
existing work preserved. Units without an existing current preparation follow
the initial plan/approval/prepare procedure.

For postapproval plan, test instruction, or Testing Contract edits in the same
Unit and attempt, use the Construction module's effective-fence rule. When the
fence is lowered, continue with the current tool-produced brief and preserve
the original approval evidence without relabelling the edits as approved.
The worker's effective plan-approval fence comes from its live verified parent
intent. Existing workers observe a lowering or raising on their next check;
do not use a copied worker setting to decide whether continuation is allowed.
Missing artifacts or malformed contract JSON require repair before execution,
not an automatic new approval ceremony.

A prior failure still uses the halt-and-ask Retry/Abort decision. Continuing the
same approved batch does not remove that human stop. An explicit batch checkpoint
Request Changes uses the revision procedure below instead.

### Resuming a reviewed batch after Request Changes

When the engine emits `resume_existing: true`, at least one pending Unit still
needs preparation or recovery for the current rejection revision. Verify the
parent's `execution_allowed` first. If the rejection retired the prior approval,
prepare the revised plans and obtain fresh Plan Approval. If a current approval
or allowed postapproval continuation already exists for the same intent, Unit,
and attempt, retain its actual approval evidence when retrying interrupted
preparation: do not clear the answer or replace its receipt just to retry setup.
`execution_allowed: true` with `ok: false` permits continuation, not a claim
that the edited content was approved or that an older attempt can be revived.

Add `--resume-existing` to the ordinary `aidlc engine swarm prepare` call
with the directive's batch number and exact Unit set. Already prepared members
are retained by the tool's idempotent path. The same flag covers these supported
worktree states:

- **The child still exists:** the tool validates and preserves its source and
  archives old framework metadata for the same rejection revision before
  re-establishing current execution evidence. Do not delete that worktree or
  substitute ordinary prepare to bypass a refusal.
- **Native source landing removed the child:** when durable landing evidence
  proves that Unit's previous source reached the parent, the tool can fork a
  fresh child from that already-landed parent source. It preserves the rejection
  revision and binds that revision's actual Plan Approval; it does not revive the old
  approval or pretend the original child survived.
- **A prepared revision child was explicitly discarded:** the native discard
  must follow that child's own creation and start. The tool correlates it with
  the earlier landing and current approval before recreating the worker.
  Directory absence or a discard of a different/older worker is insufficient.

After preparation succeeds, a later `next` continues those workers without
another Plan Approval, including when peers in the revision have already landed.

Successful native source landing may remove the child, so do not promise that
every post-merge worktree is preserved. Follow the emitted resume route and the
tool's recovery message. If source cannot be reconciled with the approved
starting point, explain the refusal and preserve the remaining work while the
human resolves it; never infer approval of a different source tree.

### Retry after a native worker discard

When the reviewer-exhaustion procedure calls for Retry, use the native
abort/discard procedure for that Unit and then call `next`. Follow its current
preparation route: `--resume-existing` for an outstanding checkpoint revision,
ordinary `prepare` for an initial batch. Preserve current valid Plan Approval;
do not replace a group's receipts merely because one worker was discarded.

When the native discard records the worker's committed approved baseline, the
tool can restore that exact source and approval even if a peer has since landed
on the parent. Other running workers retain their source, receipts, and review
attempts. The replacement gets a new Bolt start for its new reviewer attempt.
Without that source binding, the normal committed-parent preflight still
applies and names the required repair. Do not infer approval from an older
creation or from a missing directory.

Load this module for every `invoke-swarm` directive and every `run-stage` with
`directive.swarm_settled === true`; use only the subsection for the active
harness.

**Iteration and approved Units.** Unit-major remains serial and never invokes
swarm. On stage-major with explicit `Construction Execution: swarm`, skeleton-on completes and
approves the first Unit's real integrated checkpoint before eligible Code
Generation batches fan out. Use exactly `directive.units`; inline Units already
approved at their checkpoints are excluded from later swarm work. Planning,
any enabled summary confirmation (the stage protocol's
`directive.ceremony.summary_confirmation === "on"` rule), and Plan Approval remain
required for each emitted Unit.
The Construction module's **Grouped Plan Approval** may present the exact live
batch together; unsupported or legacy mediation uses individual approvals.

### Batch checkpoint

A `run-stage` with `swarm_checkpoint` is a completed batch waiting for its
completion decision before the next batch. Branch here before body, reviewer,
ordinary gate, or `swarm_settled` handling. The object carries `batch`, `units`,
`fingerprint`, `ready`, `approved`, `human_required`, and `errors`. Use the exact
batch number and comma-joined emitted Units; do not rebuild them or rerun their
reviews merely because the directive is `run-stage`.

Readiness requires every Unit's current native `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED` receipt
to carry `Command SHA-256` matching the intent's authorized Construction
Verification Command. The batch approval binds that digest too. Older receipts
without it, or a newly authorized command, require fresh native verification
before the batch can be approved; a changed command also retires prior approval.

```bash
aidlc engine bolt swarm-checkpoint --action status --batch <N> --units "<comma-separated emitted Units>"
```

If `ready` is false, explain the named evidence errors and repair the missing
source landing, verification, or review through its owning procedure. Do not
invent verification or approval. Only after status reports `ready: true` may
guided/gated completion issue `swarm-checkpoint --action ask` and use the human
question-and-answer flow below; `ask` refuses an unready batch. Automatic
completion uses the recorded autonomous policy, needs no `ask`, and omits `--user-input`.

At a human batch checkpoint, run the §13 learning-selection question only when
`directive.protocol_modules` lists `learnings`. With the module listed,
consolidate the relevant Unit diaries into that question and persist only explicit
human selections, then open the batch approval with `ask` below as a separate question and turn.
Automatic batches retain pending candidates for the next human checkpoint or
final handoff only when `directive.protocol_modules` lists `learnings`. When the
module is absent, keep no diary and ask no learning question; go straight to the
batch approval procedure when a human is required. Bookkeeping settlement never
repeats an already handled ritual.

After confirming `ready: true` and before presenting **Approve** / **Request Changes**,
bind the question to the current batch fingerprint, per-Unit `Command SHA-256`
set, and the invoking SessionStart session:

```bash
aidlc engine bolt swarm-checkpoint --action ask --batch <N> --units "<Units>" --session "<session ID>"
```

Then present the choices and wait for the human. Show "Verified with
`<full command>` (exit 0). Approve this completed batch?" using the complete
recorded command, never abbreviated. Copy the canonical `command` from the
verification-command tool output into a code span whose delimiter preserves any
backticks. The human's exact **Approve** / **Request Changes** reply in that
session, to this checkpoint question, authorizes the matching action; an unrelated
reply, another session's reply, or a reply to a different question does not.
Never pass `--user-input` the human did not choose. The response is one-shot and
bound to this batch, exact Unit set, current fingerprint, and per-Unit command
digest set. Re-running swarm `finalize` withdraws every open checkpoint question
and captured checkpoint response for this intent, in any session. After fresh
verification and source landing, obtain a new directive, confirm `ready: true`,
and ask again; a reply captured before `finalize` cannot approve the new evidence.
A human Request Changes always requires this ready question-and-answer flow,
even under autonomous policy.

```bash
# Only after a real human Approve:
aidlc engine bolt swarm-checkpoint --action approve --batch <N> --units "<Units>" --session "<session ID>" --user-input 'Approve'
# Only when human_required is false:
aidlc engine bolt swarm-checkpoint --action approve --batch <N> --units "<Units>"
# Only after a real human Request Changes:
aidlc engine bolt swarm-checkpoint --action reject --batch <N> --units "<Units>" --session "<session ID>" --user-input 'Request Changes' --reason '<human feedback>'
```

Re-run `next` after batch approval or rejection. Approval advances batch routing,
not the whole Code Generation stage. A changed fingerprint or refused action
requires current evidence and another directive, not a fabricated user answer.
Plan Approval remains mandatory for every Unit regardless of how batch completion
is approved; grouped Plan Approval changes only the presentation.

**Settled-swarm re-entry.** `swarm_settled: true` is a re-entry over completed
Unit bodies and review receipts. First apply the Construction module's metadata
routing. A `swarm_checkpoint` uses the Batch checkpoint procedure above; a
`construction_checkpoint` uses Unit checkpoint actions; a
`construction_policy.completion_only` directive skips body, questions, reviewer,
and learnings, and reports `awaiting-approval` then `approved` without
`--user-input`, then `next`. For an ordinary settle, do not dispatch builders or
reviewers again: use `human_completion_required` for the remaining completion
presentation. A false value skips routine human completion/learnings questions
and reports without invented user input. An absent policy retains the legacy
approval procedure: run the stage-level learnings ritual only when
`directive.protocol_modules` lists `learnings`, then the approval gate, and
report the human's result. This rule applies equally after session resume.

**Post-finalize source landing.** After every `finalize` call, before `next` or
the human gate, run `aidlc engine worktree merge --slug
<that converged result row's bolt_slug> --target <the same base branch used by
prepare> --strategy squash` for each result row whose status is `converged` and
which is absent from `merge_failures`. The merge recovers the creating
repository from a unique durable source authority; its intent remains the
selected workflow intent. Pass `--intent`/`--space` only when they name the
session's active workflow; swarm refuses a mismatch before mutation or audit
emission. The merge consumes the immutable `Source Commit`, disables ambient
Git hooks, and emits
`SWARM_SOURCE_MERGED`; modern convergence does not advance
the batch until that row exists. A normal non-zero result before
`[merge-succeeded:<sha>]` preserves the worktree: resolve the conflict or target
checkout problem and retry the same merge, without rerunning `finalize`. If the
message carries `[merge-succeeded:<sha>]` and `SWARM_SOURCE_MERGED` exists, the
reviewed source is already authoritative and only cleanup failed; rerun the
same merge, which performs cleanup-only reconciliation without reapplying
source or duplicating authority. If the marker exists but
`SWARM_SOURCE_MERGED` does not, do not retry the merge: preserve the worktree
and follow the named stage-restart or explicit human-approved bypass remedy.

Cleanup also refuses if the Bolt branch is checked out at a foreign worktree
path, preserving its branch and retained/parked refs. Surface the owner path;
do not treat another intent's same-named Unit as cleanup for this batch.

**Recoverable abort/discard.** In every harness's recovery path below, aborting
and discarding the old Bolt means park/discard: snapshot tracked and non-ignored
untracked files (or keep the remaining branch tip when the checkout is gone) and
park reviewed source refs before removing the live checkout and branch. The
conductor must obtain the human's selection and execute the returned recovery
command unchanged. When present, the returned `restore_operation` recovers
parked work in an isolated `.aidlc/restored/bolt-<id8>_<slug>-<stamp>` checkout on
`restore/bolt-<id8>_<slug>-<stamp>`, never overwriting a new live Bolt. Its saved
args select the exact slug, stamp, and repository, then append
`--intent <record-dir-name> --space <space>` so later execution cannot drift to
another active intent. If only review evidence remained, there are no saved
working files to restore, so neither `restore_operation` nor `restore_hint` is
returned. Namespaced and legacy restores both require the selected intent's
exact `WORKTREE_DISCARDED` `Parked ref` and stamp provenance; legacy restores
retain their legacy name. Restored artifacts and receipts are not
current-attempt evidence; retry still requires a fresh `prepare` and review
boundary as described below.

### Claude Code

The engine selected an eligible Construction batch for swarm execution. Execution is explicit on new workflows and may use gated or autonomous completion approval; a legacy workflow without the execution field retains its autonomy-based route. **You — the live `/aidlc` session — are the conductor: you own the fan-out and the retry loop; `aidlc-swarm.ts` is the deterministic referee you consult, never a loop-owner.** **Before step (1), read and follow `aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md` §12b "Autonomous Code Generation Plan Contract"; planning, fingerprinted Plan Approval, and the two worker-brief markers are mandatory for every emitted unit.** Apply **Continuing a partially completed batch**, **Before initial protected prepare**, and **Resuming a reviewed batch after Request Changes** above to select continuation or preparation before the steps below; no automatic commit is authorized by an autonomy grant. (1) **`prepare`** the batch: `aidlc engine swarm prepare --batch <n> --units <directive.units joined by comma> [--base main] [--repo <name>]` creates the initial isolated worktrees only after the batch preflight; with `--resume-existing`, use the two resume paths above. Pass `--repo` = the directive's `repo` field when present; for a MULTI-REPO intent where the directive omits `repo`, supply `--repo <name>` for the sibling repo this batch targets (read the recorded set from `/aidlc intent --json`.repos) — `prepare` errors without it on a multi-repo intent. (2) **Fan out per `AIDLC_USE_SWARM`:** unset / not `"1"` → the floor — issue N parallel `Task` calls in one assistant message, one per unit, each implementing its unit in its worktree until the project's convergence check passes; `="1"` → author an inline Dynamic Workflow (`Workflow({script, args})`, batch in `args`) whose JS owns the per-unit `pipeline` and the iteration cap. If `="1"` but the Workflow tool is unavailable, **loud-degrade to the floor** and pass `--degraded-from ultracode` on the next referee call so the tool emits `SWARM_DEGRADED`. (3) Under checkpoints, both `check` and `finalize` use the intent's recorded, human-authorized **Construction Verification Command**; omit `--check-cmd` (if supplied, it must match). If authorization is missing, complete the Construction module's command-consent procedure and `set-construction-verification-command` before running either. Legacy autonomy still requires `--check-cmd "<the project's build/test convergence check>"` on both commands. After each unit's worker turn, consult **`check <unit> [--test-file <protected spec>]`** — exit `0` = genuinely converged (the real check passed and no protected file was tampered); non-zero = not yet, and you judge retry-vs-escalate (knowledge). (4) When the loop settles, **`finalize --batch <n> --units <all> --claimed <the units you believe converged> [--reasons <unit>=<unsatisfiable|budget-exhausted|cap-exhausted>,…]`** re-verifies every claimed unit before merging (a unit you wrongly claim is refused — the lying-conductor guard) and serialised-merges the genuine passes. For any unit you did NOT claim, attribute *why* it gave up via `--reasons` (your knowledge call — `unsatisfiable` when it is fundamentally unbuildable, `budget-exhausted` when the ultracode token ceiling stopped it; an unlisted declined unit defaults to `cap-exhausted`); the tool records your attribution faithfully but never lets it override a claimed-but-red unit's `error` verdict. **Branch on `finalize`'s exit code:** `0` → this batch's reviewed record evidence and metadata converged; after the required source-landing step above, re-run `next` rather than reporting the stage yet. The engine may first return a `swarm_checkpoint` for the completed batch; resolve it before the next batch. Otherwise it returns the next `invoke-swarm` or the final `run-stage` settle directive; only on that settle directive do you apply the metadata-aware settled-swarm rule above and report its lifecycle outcome. Reporting approved after an intermediate batch would complete the stage with later batches unbuilt. `2` → it returns a failure envelope (a unit unsatisfiable, claimed-but-red, tampered, or a merge failed) — **take the baton back**: halt and re-engage the human via the halt-and-ask seam (`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md` § "Halt-and-ask on failure" — failure always halts and asks regardless of autonomy mode). For a `merge_failures` unit (converged but its merge-back failed; no `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED` row lands until the merge does), resolve the blocker and re-run `finalize` scoped to that unit: the worktree is preserved and `release-merge` is idempotent, so the retry is a pure re-invocation. Do NOT re-run `prepare` for it (the existing worktree makes `prepare` error). The swarm never escapes the conductor — the referee owns the verdict + merge + audit, you own the fan-out + retry decision. *(Optional: a human may type `/goal` at the autonomy grant to run-until-a-condition keyed off the referee's transcript output — never as the convergence judge, which stays `finalize`'s exit code.)*

**Autonomous reviewer boundary.** When an `invoke-swarm` carries `directive.reviewer`, a unit is not claimable at `finalize` merely because `check` passed. In that unit's `prepare`-created worktree, follow the reviewer contract (stage-protocol-reviewer.md §12a): record `REVIEW_REQUESTED` with `aidlc engine log review --stage "<directive.stage>" --unit "<unit>" --reviewer "<directive.reviewer>" --iteration <n> --project-dir "<worktree>"`, dispatch the reviewer against `directive.stage_file` plus that worktree's unit artifacts and contracts, then record `REVIEW_COMPLETED` with the same command plus `--verdict <READY|NOT-READY>`. The logger stays in the main workspace while `--project-dir` targets the worktree, which also works when a multi-repo worktree contains only the selected sibling repo. A NOT-READY verdict re-invokes the lead in the same worktree, reruns the convergence check, and repeats the reviewer up to `directive.reviewer_max_iterations`. If the one recovery receipt is invalidated again, do not put the Unit in `--claimed` and do not run `finalize`: halt for a human Retry/Abort decision. On Retry, return to the main workspace, abort and discard the old Bolt, then call `next` and follow **Retry after a native worker discard** above for that Unit with the original batch/repo selection; the fresh `BOLT_STARTED` boundary resets review accounting without claiming convergence. Put a unit in `--claimed` only after its terminal review receipt exists; `finalize` verifies the receipt before merge and then merges it into the main audit. When `next` returns the settle `run-stage` after all units converge, do not dispatch the reviewer again; the per-unit receipts already cover the stage, so apply only the metadata-aware settled-swarm completion procedure above. This is model work inside autonomous Construction, not another human prompt.

**After a successful retry discard.** After the `--discard` abort succeeds and
confirms the old attempt was parked, but before rerunning `prepare`, use this
SAY line. Use `On your go-ahead I` only when the human selected Retry; otherwise
use `I`, never implying a human remedy choice that did not happen. Do not
announce a saved snapshot if the abort failed or did not park an attempt.

Select `[saved-files text]` from the returned `parked_mode`:

- `snapshot`: "I saved a snapshot of its tracked files and non-ignored untracked files. Ignored files are not saved, and the snapshot may normalize line endings."
- `branch-tip`: "I kept its committed work; there were no uncommitted files to save."
- `evidence-only`: "Nothing of its working files remained to save; only its review evidence was kept."
- `null`: omit `[saved-files text]`; the fallback descriptor does not establish what was saved.

**SAY:** "[On your go-ahead I|I] set aside the previous attempt at [Unit] because the work changed again after its re-check, and I'm starting a new attempt. [saved-files text] If you want the previous attempt back, ask me to restore it."

When `restore_operation` is absent, omit the final offer: "If you want the previous attempt back, ask me to restore it." Do not invent a restore operation for an evidence-only attempt.

If the human later asks for that attempt back, use the saved abort result's
`restore_operation`: invoke its `worktree` route through
`aidlc engine worktree <args...>`, passing each listed `args` element exactly
as a separate argv argument. Never join those arguments into a shell command or
rebuild a slug-only selection. `restore_hint` is human display text only, never
an execution input. If safe rendering fails (for example, an invalid harness
directory), the hint is omitted and `restore_hint_error` explains why; the
operation remains available and the restoration offer still applies.
After restoration succeeds, announce the returned restored path plainly:
**SAY:** "I restored the previous attempt at [returned restored path]."
Restoration does not resume the old attempt or make its review current.

(2) **Fan out via the `subagent` tool**: delegate every unit in the batch in ONE delegation (whole batches are fine — concurrency is the harness's queueing concern), one parallel task per unit targeting `aidlc-developer-agent`, each implementing its unit in its worktree until the project's convergence check passes. On this harness the subagent fan-out is the ONLY swarm mode: `AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1` has no effect here (no Workflow tool exists) — if it is set, say so out loud and proceed with the fan-out, passing `--degraded-from ultracode` on the next referee call so the tool emits `SWARM_DEGRADED`. (3) Under checkpoints, both `check` and `finalize` use the intent's recorded, human-authorized **Construction Verification Command**; omit `--check-cmd` (if supplied, it must match).

Execution is explicit on new workflows and may use gated or autonomous completion approval; a legacy workflow without the execution field retains its autonomy-based route. **You — the live `/aidlc` session — are the conductor: you own the fan-out and the retry loop; `aidlc-swarm.ts` is the deterministic referee you consult, never a loop-owner.** **Before step (1), read and follow `aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md` §12b "Autonomous Code Generation Plan Contract"; planning, fingerprinted Plan Approval, and the two worker-brief markers are mandatory for every emitted unit.** Apply **Continuing a partially completed batch**, **Before initial protected prepare**, and **Resuming a reviewed batch after Request Changes** above to select continuation or preparation before the steps below; no automatic commit is authorized by an autonomy grant. (1) **`prepare`** the batch: `aidlc engine swarm prepare --batch <n> --units <directive.units joined by comma> [--base main] [--repo <name>]` creates the initial isolated worktrees only after the batch preflight; with `--resume-existing`, use the two resume paths above. Pass `--repo` = the directive's `repo` field when present; for a MULTI-REPO intent where the directive omits `repo`, supply `--repo <name>` for the sibling repo this batch targets (read the recorded set from `/aidlc intent --json`.repos) — `prepare` errors without it on a multi-repo intent. (2) **Fan out via the `subagent` tool**: delegate every unit in the batch in ONE delegation (whole batches are fine — concurrency is the harness's queueing concern), one parallel task per unit targeting `aidlc-developer-agent`, each implementing its unit in its worktree until the project's convergence check passes. On this harness the subagent fan-out is the ONLY swarm mode: `AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1` has no effect here (no Workflow tool exists) — if it is set, say so out loud and proceed with the fan-out, passing `--degraded-from ultracode` on the next referee call so the tool emits `SWARM_DEGRADED`. (3) Under checkpoints, both `check` and `finalize` use the intent's recorded, human-authorized **Construction Verification Command**; omit `--check-cmd` (if supplied, it must match). If authorization is missing, complete the Construction module's command-consent procedure and `set-construction-verification-command` before running either. Legacy autonomy still requires `--check-cmd "<the project's build/test convergence check>"` on both commands. After each unit's worker turn, consult **`check <unit> [--test-file <protected spec>]`** — exit `0` = genuinely converged; non-zero = not yet, and you judge retry-vs-escalate. (4) When the loop settles, **`finalize --batch <n> --units <all> --claimed <the units you believe converged> [--reasons <unit>=<unsatisfiable|budget-exhausted|cap-exhausted>,…]`** re-verifies every claimed unit before merging (the lying-conductor guard) and serialised-merges the genuine passes. **Branch on `finalize`'s exit code:** `0` → this batch's reviewed record evidence and metadata converged; after the required source-landing step above, re-run `next` rather than reporting the stage yet. The engine may first return a `swarm_checkpoint` for the completed batch; resolve it before the next batch. Otherwise it returns the next `invoke-swarm` or the final `run-stage` settle directive; only on that settle directive do you apply the metadata-aware settled-swarm rule above and report its lifecycle outcome. Reporting approved after an intermediate batch would complete the stage with later batches unbuilt. `2` → failure envelope — **take the baton back**: halt and re-engage the human via the halt-and-ask seam (`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md` § "Halt-and-ask on failure"). For a `merge_failures` unit (converged but its merge-back failed; no `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED` row lands until the merge does), resolve the blocker and re-run `finalize` scoped to that unit: the worktree is preserved and `release-merge` is idempotent, so the retry is a pure re-invocation; do NOT re-run `prepare` for it. The swarm never escapes the conductor.

**Autonomous reviewer boundary.** When an `invoke-swarm` carries `directive.reviewer`, a unit is not claimable at `finalize` merely because `check` passed. In that unit's `prepare`-created worktree, follow stage-protocol-reviewer.md §12a: record `REVIEW_REQUESTED` with `aidlc engine log review --stage "<directive.stage>" --unit "<unit>" --reviewer "<directive.reviewer>" --iteration <n> --project-dir "<worktree>"`, delegate to the reviewer agent against `directive.stage_file` plus that worktree's unit artifacts and contracts, then record `REVIEW_COMPLETED` with the same command plus `--verdict <READY|NOT-READY>`. The logger stays in the main workspace while `--project-dir` targets the worktree, which also works when a multi-repo worktree contains only the selected sibling repo. A NOT-READY verdict re-invokes the lead in the same worktree, reruns the convergence check, and repeats the reviewer up to `directive.reviewer_max_iterations`. If the one recovery receipt is invalidated again, do not put the Unit in `--claimed` and do not run `finalize`: halt for a human Retry/Abort decision. On Retry, return to the main workspace, abort and discard the old Bolt, then call `next` and follow **Retry after a native worker discard** above for that Unit with the original batch/repo selection; the fresh `BOLT_STARTED` boundary resets review accounting without claiming convergence. Put a unit in `--claimed` only after its terminal review receipt exists; `finalize` verifies the receipt before merge and then merges it into the main audit. When `next` returns the settle `run-stage` after all units converge, do not delegate to the reviewer again; the per-unit receipts already cover the stage, so apply only the metadata-aware settled-swarm completion procedure above. This is model work inside autonomous Construction, not another human prompt.

**After a successful retry discard.** After the `--discard` abort succeeds and
confirms the old attempt was parked, but before rerunning `prepare`, use this
SAY line. Use `On your go-ahead I` only when the human selected Retry; otherwise
use `I`, never implying a human remedy choice that did not happen. Do not
announce a saved snapshot if the abort failed or did not park an attempt.

Select `[saved-files text]` from the returned `parked_mode`:

- `snapshot`: "I saved a snapshot of its tracked files and non-ignored untracked files. Ignored files are not saved, and the snapshot may normalize line endings."
- `branch-tip`: "I kept its committed work; there were no uncommitted files to save."
- `evidence-only`: "Nothing of its working files remained to save; only its review evidence was kept."
- `null`: omit `[saved-files text]`; the fallback descriptor does not establish what was saved.

**SAY:** "[On your go-ahead I|I] set aside the previous attempt at [Unit] because the work changed again after its re-check, and I'm starting a new attempt. [saved-files text] If you want the previous attempt back, ask me to restore it."

When `restore_operation` is absent, omit the final offer: "If you want the previous attempt back, ask me to restore it." Do not invent a restore operation for an evidence-only attempt.

If the human later asks for that attempt back, use the saved abort result's
`restore_operation`: invoke its `worktree` route through
`aidlc engine worktree <args...>`, passing each listed `args` element exactly
as a separate argv argument. Never join those arguments into a shell command or
rebuild a slug-only selection. `restore_hint` is human display text only, never
an execution input. If safe rendering fails (for example, an invalid harness
directory), the hint is omitted and `restore_hint_error` explains why; the
operation remains available and the restoration offer still applies.
After restoration succeeds, announce the returned restored path plainly:
**SAY:** "I restored the previous attempt at [returned restored path]."
Restoration does not resume the old attempt or make its review current.

The engine selected an eligible Construction batch for swarm execution. Execution is explicit on new workflows and may use gated or autonomous completion approval; a legacy workflow without the execution field retains its autonomy-based route. **You — the live `$aidlc` session — are the conductor: you own the fan-out and the retry loop; `aidlc-swarm.ts` is the deterministic referee you consult, never a loop-owner.** **Before step (1), read and follow `aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md` §12b "Autonomous Code Generation Plan Contract"; planning, fingerprinted Plan Approval, and the two worker-brief markers are mandatory for every emitted unit.** Apply **Continuing a partially completed batch**, **Before initial protected prepare**, and **Resuming a reviewed batch after Request Changes** above to select continuation or preparation before the steps below; no automatic commit is authorized by an autonomy grant.

Pass `--repo` = the directive's `repo` field when present; for a MULTI-REPO intent where the directive omits `repo`, supply `--repo <name>` for the sibling repo this batch targets (read the recorded set from `$aidlc intent --json`.repos) — `prepare` errors without it on a multi-repo intent. (2) **Fan out via `codex exec` workers — the swarm floor on this harness (D-8)**: for each unit, run a headless worker `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -C <unit worktree path> "<the unit's implementation task, naming the protected spec and the convergence check>" < /dev/null` (ALWAYS close stdin with `< /dev/null` — an open pipe hangs exec). Workers run sequentially or in background shells; each implements its unit in its worktree until the project's convergence check passes. `AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1` has no effect on this harness (no Workflow tool exists) — if it is set, **say so out loud** and proceed with the exec-worker floor, passing `--degraded-from ultracode` on the next referee call so the tool emits `SWARM_DEGRADED`. (3) Under checkpoints, both `check` and `finalize` use the intent's recorded, human-authorized **Construction Verification Command**; omit `--check-cmd` (if supplied, it must match). If authorization is missing, complete the Construction module's command-consent procedure and `set-construction-verification-command` before running either. Legacy autonomy still requires `--check-cmd "<the project's build/test convergence check>"` on both commands. After each unit's worker turn, consult **`check <unit> [--test-file <protected spec>]`** — exit `0` = genuinely converged (the real check passed and no protected file was tampered); non-zero = not yet, and you judge retry-vs-escalate (knowledge; `codex exec resume` continues a worker session). (4) When the loop settles, **`finalize --batch <n> --units <all> --claimed <the units you believe converged> [--reasons <unit>=<unsatisfiable|budget-exhausted|cap-exhausted>,…]`** re-verifies every claimed unit before merging (a unit you wrongly claim is refused — the lying-conductor guard) and serialised-merges the genuine passes. For any unit you did NOT claim, attribute *why* it gave up via `--reasons`; the tool records your attribution faithfully but never lets it override a claimed-but-red unit's `error` verdict. **Branch on `finalize`'s exit code:** `0` → this batch's reviewed record evidence and metadata converged; after the required source-landing step above, re-run `next` rather than reporting the stage yet. The engine may first return a `swarm_checkpoint` for the completed batch; resolve it before the next batch. Otherwise it returns the next `invoke-swarm` or the final `run-stage` settle directive; only on that settle directive do you apply the metadata-aware settled-swarm rule above and report its lifecycle outcome.

For a `merge_failures` unit (converged but its merge-back failed; no `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED` row lands until the merge does), resolve the blocker and re-run `finalize` scoped to that unit: the worktree is preserved and `release-merge` is idempotent, so the retry is a pure re-invocation. Do NOT re-run `prepare` for it (the existing worktree makes `prepare` error). The swarm never escapes the conductor — the referee owns the verdict + merge + audit, you own the fan-out + retry decision.

**Autonomous reviewer boundary.** When an `invoke-swarm` carries `directive.reviewer`, a unit is not claimable at `finalize` merely because `check` passed. In that unit's `prepare`-created worktree, follow stage-protocol-reviewer.md §12a: record `REVIEW_REQUESTED` with `aidlc engine log review --stage "<directive.stage>" --unit "<unit>" --reviewer "<directive.reviewer>" --iteration <n> --project-dir "<worktree>"`, spawn the reviewer role against `directive.stage_file` plus that worktree's unit artifacts and contracts, then record `REVIEW_COMPLETED` with the same command plus `--verdict <READY|NOT-READY>`. The logger stays in the main workspace while `--project-dir` targets the worktree, which also works when a multi-repo worktree contains only the selected sibling repo. A NOT-READY verdict re-invokes the lead in the same worktree, reruns the convergence check, and repeats the reviewer up to `directive.reviewer_max_iterations`.

On Retry, return to the main workspace, abort and discard the old Bolt, then call `next` and follow **Retry after a native worker discard** above for that Unit with the original batch/repo selection; the fresh `BOLT_STARTED` boundary resets review accounting without claiming convergence.

Execution is explicit on new workflows and may use gated or autonomous completion approval; a legacy workflow without the execution field retains its autonomy-based route. **You — the live `/aidlc` session — are the conductor: you own the fan-out and the retry loop; `aidlc-swarm.ts` is the deterministic referee you consult, never a loop-owner.** **Before step (1), read and follow `aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md` §12b "Autonomous Code Generation Plan Contract"; planning, fingerprinted Plan Approval, and the two worker-brief markers are mandatory for every emitted unit.** Apply **Continuing a partially completed batch**, **Before initial protected prepare**, and **Resuming a reviewed batch after Request Changes** above to select continuation or preparation before the steps below; no automatic commit is authorized by an autonomy grant. (1) **`prepare`** the batch: `aidlc engine swarm prepare --batch <n> --units <directive.units joined by comma> [--base main] [--repo <name>]` creates the initial isolated worktrees only after the batch preflight; with `--resume-existing`, use the two resume paths above. Pass `--repo` = the directive's `repo` field when present; for a MULTI-REPO intent where the directive omits `repo`, supply `--repo <name>` for the sibling repo this batch targets (read the recorded set from `/aidlc intent --json`.repos) — `prepare` errors without it on a multi-repo intent. (2) **Fan out via subagent delegation**: delegate every unit in the batch in ONE turn, one parallel delegation per unit targeting `aidlc-developer-agent`, each implementing its unit in its worktree until the project's convergence check passes. On this harness the subagent fan-out is the ONLY swarm mode: `AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1` has no effect here (no Workflow tool exists) — if it is set, say so out loud and proceed with the fan-out, passing `--degraded-from ultracode` on the next referee call so the tool emits `SWARM_DEGRADED`. (3) Under checkpoints, both `check` and `finalize` use the intent's recorded, human-authorized **Construction Verification Command**; omit `--check-cmd` (if supplied, it must match). If authorization is missing, complete the Construction module's command-consent procedure and `set-construction-verification-command` before running either. Legacy autonomy still requires `--check-cmd "<the project's build/test convergence check>"` on both commands. After each unit's worker turn, consult **`check <unit> [--test-file <protected spec>]`** — exit `0` = genuinely converged; non-zero = not yet, and you judge retry-vs-escalate. (4) When the loop settles, **`finalize --batch <n> --units <all> --claimed <the units you believe converged> [--reasons <unit>=<unsatisfiable|budget-exhausted|cap-exhausted>,…]`** re-verifies every claimed unit before merging (the lying-conductor guard) and serialised-merges the genuine passes. **Branch on `finalize`'s exit code:** `0` → this batch's reviewed record evidence and metadata converged; after the required source-landing step above, re-run `next` rather than reporting the stage yet. The engine may first return a `swarm_checkpoint` for the completed batch; resolve it before the next batch. Otherwise it returns the next `invoke-swarm` or the final `run-stage` settle directive; only on that settle directive do you apply the metadata-aware settled-swarm rule above and report its lifecycle outcome. Reporting approved after an intermediate batch would complete the stage with later batches unbuilt. `2` → failure envelope — **take the baton back**: halt and re-engage the human via the halt-and-ask seam (`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md` § "Halt-and-ask on failure"). For a `merge_failures` unit (converged but its merge-back failed; no `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED` row lands until the merge does), resolve the blocker and re-run `finalize` scoped to that unit: the worktree is preserved and `release-merge` is idempotent, so the retry is a pure re-invocation; do NOT re-run `prepare` for it. The swarm never escapes the conductor.

**Autonomous reviewer boundary.** When an `invoke-swarm` carries `directive.reviewer`, a unit is not claimable at `finalize` merely because `check` passed. In that unit's `prepare`-created worktree, follow stage-protocol-reviewer.md §12a: record `REVIEW_REQUESTED` with `aidlc engine log review --stage "<directive.stage>" --unit "<unit>" --reviewer "<directive.reviewer>" --iteration <n> --project-dir "<worktree>"`, dispatch the reviewer task against `directive.stage_file` plus that worktree's unit artifacts and contracts, then record `REVIEW_COMPLETED` with the same command plus `--verdict <READY|NOT-READY>`. The logger stays in the main workspace while `--project-dir` targets the worktree, which also works when a multi-repo worktree contains only the selected sibling repo. A NOT-READY verdict re-invokes the lead in the same worktree, reruns the convergence check, and repeats the reviewer up to `directive.reviewer_max_iterations`. If the one recovery receipt is invalidated again, do not put the Unit in `--claimed` and do not run `finalize`: halt for a human Retry/Abort decision. On Retry, return to the main workspace, abort and discard the old Bolt, then call `next` and follow **Retry after a native worker discard** above for that Unit with the original batch/repo selection; the fresh `BOLT_STARTED` boundary resets review accounting without claiming convergence. Put a unit in `--claimed` only after its terminal review receipt exists; `finalize` verifies the receipt before merge and then merges it into the main audit. When `next` returns the settle `run-stage` after all units converge, do not dispatch the reviewer again; the per-unit receipts already cover the stage, so apply only the metadata-aware settled-swarm completion procedure above. This is model work inside autonomous Construction, not another human prompt.

**After a successful retry discard.** After the `--discard` abort succeeds and
confirms the old attempt was parked, but before rerunning `prepare`, use this
SAY line. Use `On your go-ahead I` only when the human selected Retry; otherwise
use `I`, never implying a human remedy choice that did not happen. Do not
announce a saved snapshot if the abort failed or did not park an attempt.

Select `[saved-files text]` from the returned `parked_mode`:

- `snapshot`: "I saved a snapshot of its tracked files and non-ignored untracked files. Ignored files are not saved, and the snapshot may normalize line endings."
- `branch-tip`: "I kept its committed work; there were no uncommitted files to save."
- `evidence-only`: "Nothing of its working files remained to save; only its review evidence was kept."
- `null`: omit `[saved-files text]`; the fallback descriptor does not establish what was saved.

**SAY:** "[On your go-ahead I|I] set aside the previous attempt at [Unit] because the work changed again after its re-check, and I'm starting a new attempt. [saved-files text] If you want the previous attempt back, ask me to restore it."

When `restore_operation` is absent, omit the final offer: "If you want the previous attempt back, ask me to restore it." Do not invent a restore operation for an evidence-only attempt.

If the human later asks for that attempt back, use the saved abort result's
`restore_operation`: invoke its `worktree` route through
`aidlc engine worktree <args...>`, passing each listed `args` element exactly
as a separate argv argument. Never join those arguments into a shell command or
rebuild a slug-only selection. `restore_hint` is human display text only, never
an execution input. If safe rendering fails (for example, an invalid harness
directory), the hint is omitted and `restore_hint_error` explains why; the
operation remains available and the restoration offer still applies.
After restoration succeeds, announce the returned restored path plainly:
**SAY:** "I restored the previous attempt at [returned restored path]."
Restoration does not resume the old attempt or make its review current.

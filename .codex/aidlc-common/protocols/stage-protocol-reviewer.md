# Reviewer Protocol Module

Load this module when a directive names a reviewer with an effective review class other than `none`.

## 12a. Reviewer Invocation

If the `run-stage` directive includes a `reviewer` field (non-null), the orchestrator MUST invoke the reviewer as a **separate sub-agent** after the stage body produces its artifacts and before the §13 learnings ritual when the directive lists the `learnings` protocol module, otherwise before the approval gate.

The directive's `review_class` field tells you HOW the review runs - the engine has already resolved it (stage declaration, lowered by the scope's `review_cap` and any per-run `--review` override; a `none` resolution omits the reviewer block entirely, so a directive that carries a reviewer always carries a class):

- **`adversarial`** - the refute-and-repair loop below, up to `reviewer_max_iterations` passes with lead fixes between them. The default for Construction stages, where findings are machine-checkable and fix loops converge.
- **`advisory`** - ONE normal-flow review pass as decision support for the human gate (`reviewer_max_iterations` is 1). Whatever the verdict, do NOT re-invoke the lead and do NOT re-run the reviewer during normal flow: record the terminal receipt, proceed to §13 only when the `learnings` module is listed (otherwise directly to the approval gate), and quote the reviewer's findings VERBATIM at the approval gate for the human to triage. The bounded stale-receipt recovery below is the only exception. The default for the human-gated ideation/inception prose stages, where readiness is a judgment call that belongs to the human at the gate.

### What the user hears from this section

A directive's `narration` value covers entering a stage; it cannot reach inside one, and this check happens inside. So three sentences are written for it here, and each is the whole of what the user hears at that moment. Only the double-quoted text is ever spoken; fill the `[bracketed]` slots and drop the brackets.

- Before the check - **SAY:** "Let me have the [reviewer's trade] check this over before you see it."
- Findings came back and you are fixing them - **SAY:** "Fair points came back, let me tighten [the specific thing, in plain terms] and re-check." Once per round, never once per finding.
- Concerns remain after the last round - **SAY:** "I had this checked [N] times and [N] concern[s] are still open. They are in the artifact and I will flag them at the decision below, so you can judge whether they matter."
- A revision changed the work, so the check runs again - **SAY:** "Those changes are in. Let me get them checked over again before you look."

Everything else in this section is silent. Nothing is said about invoking, handing off, sub-agents, iterations, budgets, receipts, dispatch records, the exempt list, or a verdict as a token: the user hears "a second look", never "the reviewer returned NOT-READY". Nor is the trigger for a re-check explained in the framework's terms: which declared outputs an edit touched, whether a recorded verdict is now stale, and what has to be re-recorded are all internal, so the sentence above is the whole of it. Name the trade, never the agent's file or slug. When the field is absent this check does not run, and that is not something the user hears either, in any wording: go straight to the next thing you actually do. Reasoning aloud about whether a branch applies is the surest way to leak internal vocabulary, because the only words for it are internal ones.

### Flow

**Reviewed outputs and summary inputs.** When a stage declares
`summary_confirmation` (`required` or `if-present`), declared `*-questions`
artifacts are writable human inputs. Their file manifest entry is
`summary-input:sha256:<digest>`: after normalizing line endings,
`summaryInputReviewFingerprint` masks only one visible summary-confirmation
answer value (blank, `Looks correct`, or `Request changes`). Trailing comments
and examples inside code fences remain bound. All other question
content remains bound; an absent or ambiguous confirmation section/answer
leaves the full normalized content bound. Missing and non-file entries remain
distinct. Required-file presence and safe capture checks still apply, and
snapshots retain the actual question bytes for swarm merging. Only confirmation
bookkeeping preserves the review fingerprint; substantive question edits
invalidate its content binding even though the human Q&A write is permitted.
Reviewed outputs stay frozen. If `review_artifact` explicitly names a questions
artifact, it remains fully byte-bound and frozen, including its answer line.
Without `summary_confirmation`, there is no question exception. The reviewer
itself still writes only its `reviewFile`.

Generation requires the human's exact `[Answer]: Looks correct` at the
consolidated-summary checkpoint and a successful matching
`aidlc-log.ts answer` receipt. Identical reconfirmation in the same attempt
preserves output authorization; a gate rejection alone does not withdraw it,
although review receipts follow their own rejection boundary. Changed confirmed
content requires fresh human confirmation, outputs regenerated or re-saved under
that authorization, and a fresh review through normal recovery. Use the offered
lifecycle remedy before editing frozen outputs. A summary `Request changes`
answer withdraws active summary authorization; ask "What should change?" and
end the turn before editing answers. Never invent an answer or treat editable
questions as approval to change reviewed outputs or a plan.

The logger rechecks summary confirmation and output admission when recording
a terminal verdict; an unchanged review fingerprint alone is insufficient.
Once an `if-present` flow records a summary-confirmation decision or confirmation
in the current attempt, deleting the questions file cannot remove that
obligation. Older question fingerprint projections may require a fresh review
through normal recovery; do not rewrite receipts or assume a new receipt format.

1. **Invoke reviewer sub-agent.** Before every dispatch, not only the first,
   record the request:
   `aidlc engine log review --stage "<directive.stage>" --reviewer "<directive.reviewer>" --iteration <n>`;
   add `--unit "<directive.unit>"` on a per-unit stage and `--single` on an
   isolated stage run. The request is accepted only after the stage's
   consolidated answers are confirmed and every verifiable required output
   document exists. Per-unit stages also enforce membership when the
   authoritative Unit set resolves; inability to resolve that set does not
   refuse the request, while a resolved set still refuses a Unit that is absent.
   A named Unit's required outputs remain mandatory. If the request is refused,
   finish the named prerequisite before dispatching the reviewer.

   The logger captures every declared artifact through one stable file-identity
   snapshot and binds the request to the review manifest above, plus the current
   workspace and per-unit source fingerprints where applicable. For a per-unit
   `workspace_requires` stage it validates `source-manifest.json` and binds both
   its bytes and the currently claimed source bytes into `REVIEW_REQUESTED`; it
   refuses before dispatch when the manifest is missing or invalid. The
   successful request's JSON returns `requestId` and `reviewFile`: the
   project-relative path, under `<record>/.aidlc-engine/reviews/`, where this
   request's review is written. The request opens that slot (an earlier draft
   left there by an incomplete dispatch of the same iteration is removed), so
   the file the reviewer leaves is this dispatch's review and no other. It also
   returns `recordVerdict`, the exact command step 3 runs to close this request
   (the same request command with `--verdict <READY|NOT-READY>` added): a
   request left open refuses the stage completion later, for a reason that does
   not name it.

   `directive.review_artifact` names the one required Markdown output the
   review is about: the record is keyed to it, the gate names it as the
   `**Review:**` path, and finding selectors address it. Nobody writes to it
   during a review; no produces-list position, plugin-added output, or
   directory enumeration may redefine it. On a per-unit review it resolves
   inside that Unit.

   On a re-dispatch (adversarial iteration greater than 1, a Part 0 revision
   re-review, or stale-receipt recovery), run
   `aidlc engine review-brief context --stage "<directive.stage>"`;
   add `--unit "<directive.unit>"` on a per-unit review. Retain the complete
   stdout as `Prior findings (carry IDs forward)` for the dispatch brief. The
   tool renders the previous review record (or a legacy embedded section) with
   durable human dispositions from the audit ledger overlaid, so `Accepted
   risk` and `Rejected: <reason>` survive without touching any artifact.

   Then delegate to the reviewer agent named in `directive.reviewer`. The
   request remains unmatched while the reviewer runs, so the approval gate and
   completion stay blocked.

   Pass:
   - The stage definition file path (`directive.stage_file`)
   - The Q&A file path (e.g., `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/<stage>-questions.md`)
   - All artifact file paths produced by the stage (the `produces` artifacts)
   - The `reviewFile` path from the request JSON, as the one file the reviewer writes
   - On every re-dispatch named above, `Prior findings (carry IDs forward):` followed by the review-context tool output verbatim. The reviewer MUST preserve those IDs and update their statuses rather than replacing or renumbering the prior list.
   - The resolved paths in `directive.consumes` - all upstream artifacts the stage declares - paths only, per the context-budget rule. This applies to **every** reviewer-bearing stage, not only per-unit ones:
     - For a **per-unit** stage (`directive.unit` present) these include the shared inception contracts that pin cross-unit boundaries (`components.md`, `contract-summary.md`, `unit-of-work.md`).
     - For a **workflow-level** stage with no `directive.unit` (e.g. `contract-design`), these are the upstream artifacts that justify the produced output - the unit DAG (`unit-of-work.md`, `unit-of-work-dependency.md`), the component catalogue (`components.md`), and `requirements.md` - so the reviewer can verify the contracts against the boundaries, entities, and NFRs they formalise rather than reviewing the summary in isolation.
   - The validation tools list from the stage definition's frontmatter (if any)
   - The review-content boundary: tell the reviewer not to raise a finding whose sole subject is this stage's own review bookkeeping. Treat text as this stage's own review bookkeeping when its sole purpose is to record a review iteration, revision count or revision-round label, to list or status this stage's findings in any form including a table or a section of its own, to state the stage's own review state (`draft`, `awaiting review`, `awaiting re-review`, `reviewed`), or to name this stage's review-record path; judge the product claims instead. An inline tag naming an upstream stage's finding is provenance; a tag naming this stage's own finding is bookkeeping.
   - For a per-unit `workspace_requires` stage, the unit's
     `source-manifest.json` path and its claimed source paths. Review the
     implementation differentially at those paths rather than sweeping the
     whole workspace; treat any claim that looks unrelated to the unit as a
     finding.

   Do NOT pass: `memory.md` (builder's diary) or any plan/reasoning files. The reviewer forms independent judgment.

   **Reviewer read scope.** The reviewer's scope is the current unit's artifacts plus the passed contract paths. On a per-unit stage the reviewer MUST NOT read other units' `construction/<other-unit>/` content through any tool - not by opening files, and not via grep, glob, or shell patterns that span sibling unit paths (a `construction/*/` glob is a sibling read, not a search) - except to spot-check an integration point the current unit's design explicitly names, and only the owning file, resolved via the shared contracts rather than by browsing or searching the sibling's directory. Cross-unit contract verification runs against the shared inception artifacts passed above, not against a sweep of sibling units' design prose.

   **Dispatch record (per-unit reviews; enforcement-capable harnesses only).** This record is required only when the current harness registers reviewer-scope PreToolUse enforcement (Claude Code, Kiro CLI, Codex CLI, opencode, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot today). Immediately before invoking a per-unit reviewer - `directive.unit` present, or one unit of an `invoke-swarm` reviewed under the swarm module's autonomous reviewer boundary - on one of those harnesses, write `<record>/.aidlc-engine/reviewer-dispatch.json`:

   ```json
   {"reviewer": "<directive.reviewer>", "stage": "<stage slug>", "unit": "<directive.unit, or the swarm unit under review>",
    "exempt": ["<each resolved directive.consumes path>", "<stage file path>", "<Q&A file path>"]}
   ```

   When the current unit's design explicitly names an integration point in a sibling unit's file, resolve that single owning file via the shared contracts and append its path to `exempt` - the record is where the spot-check carve-out is granted. The `stage` field appears verbatim in any `REVIEWER_SCOPE_BLOCKED` audit row; use the current stage slug. The reviewer-scope PreToolUse hook reads this record to enforce the read-scope bound deterministically while the review is in flight; on a NOT-READY re-invoke (step 3 back to step 1), write a fresh record. Single-stage and other no-unit reviews write no record; under a swarm the record is per unit - written before that unit's reviewer and deleted at its step 3 before the next unit's review begins. The record always lives in the main workspace's intent record - the path the conductor's reviewer-scope hook resolves - never in the unit's worktree, even though `--project-dir` targets the worktree for the review request and receipt; the reviewer's tool calls run under the conductor's hooks, and the hook judges `construction/<unit>/` tokens in worktree paths the same way. On a harness without reviewer-scope enforcement (Kiro IDE today), do not write the record; the reviewer read-scope bound remains mandatory prose in the delegated task and reviewer persona.

   If that dispatch fails, times out, or ends without a recorded verdict - the
   session died, or the reviewer returned an incomplete attempt (step 3: no
   review file, or one without a single canonical verdict) - return to the
   start of this step and rerun the same request command with `--retry-pending`
   immediately before dispatching again. The logger accepts it exactly once,
   only while that exact request is unmatched and the review manifest and
   workspace source exactly match the original request; it reuses those
   original fingerprints and request id instead of rebaselining current bytes,
   marks the retry in the audit, reopens the review slot, and does not consume
   another review iteration. Never use `--retry-pending` after a verdict; a
   receipt-invalidating write creates a new recovery request at the next
   ordinal, not a retry of the completed one.
2. **Reviewer executes.** An `adversarial` review runs under the **adversarial review contract**:

   - **Refute, don't confirm.** The reviewer's job is to refute the artifact, not to confirm it. It assumes defects exist and hunts for them; READY is the verdict it fails to reach after trying to break the artifact, not the default it starts from.
   - **Ground findings in machine-checkable evidence where it exists.** The reviewer runs the validation tools the invocation lists (via shell) and checks the artifact against its acceptance criteria, its stage definition, and the consumed upstream contracts. A finding backed only by opinion is a suggestion, not grounds for NOT-READY.

   An `advisory` review keeps the evidence-grounding rule but not the refute-until-READY posture: tell the reviewer in the dispatch brief that this is a SINGLE normal-flow advisory pass whose findings go to the human at the approval gate - report only findings the human should weigh before approving, ranked by severity, with no fix-and-re-review loop behind it. The stale-receipt recovery below is a separate bounded request, not a repair loop.

   The reviewer sub-agent:
   - Reads the stage definition to understand what SHOULD have been produced
   - Reads the Q&A to understand context and constraints
   - Reads the artifact(s) to evaluate what WAS produced
   - Verifies cross-unit contract claims against the passed shared inception contracts, not by sweeping or searching sibling units' design directories (no cross-unit grep or glob patterns); opens another unit's file only when the current unit's design explicitly names it as an integration point, and only that file
   - Runs any validation tools listed (via shell) and includes results in findings
   - Writes exactly ONE file: its review, at the passed `reviewFile` path. The review uses the knowledge template and contains exactly one rendered `**Verdict:** READY|NOT-READY`, one rendered `**Reviewer:** <directive.reviewer>`, and one rendered `**Iteration:** <n>` line, with its findings under `### Findings` in the template's table. It may open with the template's `## Review` heading and use H3+ subsections, but no later H1, H2, setext, or raw-HTML H1/H2 heading may open unowned top-level content. Literal headings and ownership-field examples inside fenced or inline code do not count. Step 3 treats anything else as an incomplete review.
   - Writes NOTHING else: not the Q&A, not the reviewed artifact, not any other `produces[]` output, not `source-manifest.json`, not a claimed source path. The verdict certifies the dispatched reviewed output bytes and bound question content; the logger refuses a verdict whose review manifest or source binding changed.
   - Returns a response whose FIRST line is its identity marker verbatim
     (`**Reviewer:** <reviewer-agent-name>`), so the `SUBAGENT_COMPLETED` audit
     event records which reviewer ran. The reviewer's persona owns this contract.

   When the review artifact is also the subject of a Plan Approval (Code Generation
   declares `code-generation-plan` as both), recording the review does NOT touch
   the plan, so the approval is unaffected. The approval fingerprint still
   projects out a terminal `## Review` section left in the plan by a review
   recorded before review records existed; nothing new is written there.

3. **Read verdict.** After the reviewer returns (when the dispatch comes back before its review exists, run `aidlc engine orchestrate wait --stage <directive.stage> --for review --review-file <reviewFile>` and re-run it while it answers `status: waiting`; never a shell loop), delete `<record>/.aidlc-engine/reviewer-dispatch.json` if one was written (the enforcement window closes with the review; a leftover record would keep refusing sibling access for later, unrelated work), then record the terminal receipt with the same `aidlc-log.ts review` command plus `--verdict <READY|NOT-READY>` (and the same `--unit` / `--single` fields). The logger reads the review from the request's `reviewFile` (pass `--review-file <path>` to name another file), validates it with Bun's Markdown parser (fenced/inline code and HTML comments cannot supply or conflict with authority fields, list/blockquote/table containers cannot mint ownership, and rendered Markdown or raw-HTML H1/H2 headings are section escapes), rechecks current summary confirmation and output admission, proves from one coherent snapshot that the review manifest (including reviewed output bytes and bound question content) and the request-time source identity are unchanged, and then writes the review record `<record>/.aidlc-engine/reviews/<stage>/stage/<attempt>/<iteration>.json` (or the Unit path under `units/<unit>/`) (verdict, findings, reviewer, request id, artifact and source fingerprints, and the review text) in the same locked transaction as the `REVIEW_COMPLETED` row that names the record and pins its digest. The record is the review; only this command writes one, and a record edited afterwards stops being the review because its digest no longer matches. The command's JSON returns `reviewRecord`, the record's path relative to the intent record. It also writes a readable copy of the review text for people at `<stage dir>/reviews/review-NN.md`, beside the artifact the review is about, and returns it as `reviewMarkdown`; the copy is not an artifact, nothing reads it back, and the JSON record stays the review.

   Anything else is an INCOMPLETE attempt, not a verdict: no review file at all (the reviewer has a hard turn cap and may have been stopped before writing it; the request opened an empty slot, so a missing file means an incomplete review on every path, first entry or revision alike), a review with no canonical verdict line or one that does not match `--verdict`, forged/missing/conflicting duplicate ownership fields, a later top-level heading, or a malformed findings table. The logger refuses these; a malformed audit `REVIEW_COMPLETED` row is ignored and does not consume the pending request.

   **On an incomplete attempt:** no verdict exists to record, so the step-1
   request is still unmatched. If the ledger does not yet mark a retry on this
   request, re-dispatch it exactly once - return to step 1 and rerun the same
   request command with `--retry-pending` immediately before dispatch. The
   logger accepts this only while the request is unmatched, has not already
   spent its retry, and the original review manifest and source bytes are unchanged;
   it consumes no review iteration and never mints a new fingerprint. A valid
   unmatched request recorded before review records (or before source binding)
   may emit exactly one audit-marked `Upgrade: legacy-request` modern binding,
   but only while its recorded artifact fingerprint still matches; the reviewer
   MUST then be freshly dispatched. A field-light historical
   `Retry: pending-request` marker is not a modern binding and therefore does
   not block that one modernization, while the modern upgrade row itself spends
   the retry and blocks every later retry. A structurally malformed request row
   has no authority and is ignored, so a fresh normal request may reuse its
   ordinal. If the retried attempt is ALSO incomplete, stop retrying: record the
   terminal receipt with `--verdict NOT-READY` and no review file; the logger
   accepts a missing review only for this retried NOT-READY fallback, and
   writes an empty review record for it. Proceed as that NOT-READY verdict directs for the
   effective review class - on `advisory` it is terminal (present the gate using
   the required Review brief below, with
   `--fallback-finding "review did not complete within its turn budget"` so the
   recorded finding uses the normal table shape); on `adversarial` with
   iterations remaining, skip the lead re-invoke (the artifact itself was never
   reviewed, so there is nothing for the builder to act on) and go directly
   back to step 1 with a fresh iteration and a fresh request; on `adversarial`
   with iterations exhausted, proceed to the gate using the same fallback
   Review brief. Recording the receipt is what keeps the engine's gate and
   completion precondition satisfiable: the gate is never presented on a
   silently missing verdict, and never deadlocks on one either.

   **Migration (deprecated).** A review embedded as a terminal `## Review`
   section in `directive.review_artifact` is still readable: the gate brief and
   the redispatch context render it when no record exists for that scope. A
   reviewer that still appends one is tolerated for this release cycle only:
   the logger accepts the section as the verdict when it provably postdates the
   request (the bytes before it are exactly the requested bytes and the request
   saw no section), copies that validated section into the review record, and the
   embedded input form is removed in the next minor release. Do not write an
   embedded section; the old section stays where it is as inert content.

   The recorded receipt is TERMINAL whenever no further review pass follows it: do not write reviewed outputs between recording it and gate approval; summary-owned questions follow the separate boundary above; for a per-unit `workspace_requires` stage, also do not write the unit's `source-manifest.json` or any claimed source path (a later write is deterministically invalidated at completion and the engine refuses the gate). A verdict may arrive with optional suggestions riding along; do NOT apply them - quote them verbatim in the completion summary for the human to weigh at the gate. A suggestion is gate input, not a defect (step 2: it is not grounds for NOT-READY, so it is not grounds for editing past the terminal receipt either). Riding suggestions also never change the gate itself: keep the §1 approval question's standard option order (Approve first, Request Changes second) - do not present Request Changes as the recommended or first option because a suggestion exists. On harnesses with PreToolUse enforcement the review-freeze hook refuses writes to those reviewed `produces[]`/`optional_produces[]` outputs (`REVIEW_FREEZE_BLOCKED`); manifest and claimed-source writes are caught by the completion guard rather than the hook. A recorded gate rejection lifts the freeze for the revision path.
   If a write still invalidates the receipt, what happens next is decided by
   the intent's Guard Policy value (`/aidlc --status` shows it). Under
   `strict`, the first request after that stale terminal evidence is exactly
   one recovery review at the next ordinal, even when an adversarial stage had
   unused normal iterations. The logger marks it `Recovery: stale-receipt`; the
   reviewed-output freeze stays on throughout (the reviewer writes its review beside the
   artifact, never inside it). Record either verdict as terminal, then stop
   editing reviewed outputs, `source-manifest.json`, and claimed source
   paths. Any human gate after that recovery verdict uses the required Review
   brief below with `Why now: Re-check after the artifact changed.` If that
   recovery receipt is invalidated again, request no further review. On an
   interactive stage, present the recovery-spent refusal to the human; only
   Request Changes (`GATE_REJECTED`) resets the attempt. Under `relaxed` or
   `off`, the receipt stays valid and no recovery review is requested: the gate or
   completion records one `CHANGE_ACCEPTED` row, the engine's `report`
   directive (or the tool's JSON) carries one `change_notices` line for the
   human, and the Review brief below says `Reviewed content differs` with the
   changed paths. The reviewer's verdict is never altered, and the freeze
   remains this protocol's obligation under both values; under `relaxed` or
   `off` the review-freeze fence stands aside for work nobody directed and
   records `GUARD_STOOD_ASIDE` instead of refusing, so the obligation is met by
   following this protocol rather than by a refusal.
   **Review brief (required at every reviewer-backed human gate).** Before the
   structured approval question, run
   `aidlc engine review-brief review --stage "<directive.stage>" --why <first|revision|stale>`;
   on the final `gate: true` re-entry of a per-unit stage, omit `--unit` because
   that one human decision covers every Unit and approval records dispositions
   for every Unit's open findings. Unit-filtered `context` output remains mandatory for
   each reviewer dispatch. Select `first` after the initial review, `revision`
   after a requested revision, and `stale` after artifact/source invalidation or
   a backward jump. Print stdout verbatim. It deterministically renders the
   stage, plain-language outcome, path-specific reason, every review artifact
   and hydrated findings table, and the two decision effects without exposing
   the raw verdict token. On the
   terminal incomplete-attempt fallback, add
   `--fallback-finding "review did not complete within its turn budget"` so the
   same table shape names the recorded finding.

   This tool output is the opening of the reviewer-backed gate presentation;
   the `**Review:**` artifact-path line and structured approval question follow
   it. Do not replace it with a finding count, a generic request to review, or
   an internal verdict token.

   Gate dispositions are receipt-safe audit data, never artifact edits:
   - **Approve** automatically maps every current `New` or `Unresolved` finding
     to `Accepted risk` on the tool-owned `GATE_APPROVED` row.
   - **Request Changes** leaves open findings unresolved. When the human
     explicitly rejects a finding as inapplicable, append
     `--reject-finding "<review-artifact>#R-NN=<exact human reason>"` to the
     ordinary rejected report command for each rejected finding. Never infer a
     rejection from generic revision feedback. The state tool validates the
     artifact, ID, current status, and nonblank reason before recording
     `Rejected: <reason>` on `GATE_REJECTED`.

   **Review bookkeeping is not artifact content.** The review record carries the
   verdict, findings, reviewer, request id and artifact fingerprint; the ledger
   carries the human dispositions; and `REVIEW_COMPLETED` pins the record's digest.
   So do not copy this stage's own review history into a `produces[]` artifact, in
   any form - a header line, a heading, a table, or a section of its own: not a
   revision counter or revision-round label, not a list or table of which of its
   findings a revision applied, not a finding's status, not the stage's own review
   state (`draft`, `awaiting review`, `awaiting re-review`, `reviewed`), not a
   review-record path. Such a copy is unverified and it goes stale by construction
   rather than by mistake: the gate can approve while the artifact's own note still
   says a review is pending. What the artifact says about its own subject is
   untouched: a decision record's lifecycle status - the
   `## Status: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNN]` heading an
   ADR is told to carry - or any state the customer's own process owns, is content
   and stays. An
   inline provenance tag is different only when it preserves a tag already carried
   by a consumed upstream artifact or cites an upstream stage's finding as the
   source of a downstream claim. A tag naming this stage's own finding or review
   iteration is review bookkeeping and is prohibited. The reviewer half of this
   rule travels in the dispatch list above, because that is the only text a
   dispatched reviewer receives.

   **On an `advisory` review, both verdicts are terminal here.** Do not
   re-invoke the lead or the reviewer during normal flow; proceed to section
   13, then present the approval gate using the required Review brief above.
   The human triages; a Request Changes at the gate is how an advisory finding
   becomes a revision. If a reviewed output, `source-manifest.json`, or
   claimed source path was written after the terminal receipt and voided it,
   the engine permits exactly one recovery request at the next ordinal; record
   its verdict, stop editing those same surfaces, and present the gate using
   the Review brief with `Why now: Re-check after the artifact changed.`

   **On an `adversarial` review**, branch on the verdict:
   - **READY** → the receipt is terminal (above); run the §13 learnings ritual only when `directive.protocol_modules` lists `learnings`, then present the approval gate using the required Review brief above
   - **NOT-READY** and `reviewIterations < reviewer_max_iterations` (default 2):
     - Increment review iteration counter
     - Re-invoke the stage's lead agent ALONE, dispatched per `directive.mode` (inline in your context, or as a subagent on the dispatched modes). On an ensemble stage (pipeline/mob) the room or chain is NOT re-convened - review findings are artifact defects and the lead owns the artifacts; the repair loop is lead-reviewer ping-pong (`stage-protocol-ensemble.md` §5). The builder addresses the findings and updates the artifact.
     - Return to step 1 (re-invoke reviewer)
   - **NOT-READY** and iterations exhausted:
     - Proceed to the approval gate using the required Review brief above, with the unresolved findings table and `Why now: Revision re-checked.` The separate SAY sentence for exhausted rounds remains the only narration before that gate.

The reviewer also re-runs on the Part 0 revision path: when a human rejection
leads to a revision that changes a reviewed output or bound question content, re-run this step
before reporting `revised` - the engine already treats the earlier review as
stale (its receipt predates the revised content), and the new request binds
the revised bytes, so step 3 cannot mistake the old review for coverage of the
revision. An `adversarial` review re-enters with
the same lead-alone loop and iteration budget as at first entry; an
`advisory` review re-runs as one fresh advisory pass (its findings ride the
re-presented gate using the required Review brief with `Why now: Revision
re-checked.`).

### What the reviewer does NOT do

- Does not modify the artifact, or any other declared output, at all: its only write is the review file the request named
- Does not communicate with the builder directly (all mediated by orchestrator)
- Does not access the builder's plan.md or memory.md
- Does not block the workflow — the human always gets final say at the gate
- Does not fire for stages without a `reviewer` field in the directive

## Harness reviewer bindings

Use only the subsection that matches the active harness.

### Claude Code

If `directive.reviewer` is present, invoke the reviewer as a sub-agent (via `Task` targeting the reviewer agent).

---

### Kiro CLI

If `directive.reviewer` is present, invoke the reviewer as a sub-agent (via the `subagent` tool targeting the reviewer agent config).

---

### Kiro IDE

If `directive.reviewer` is present, invoke the reviewer as a sub-agent (via the `subagent` tool targeting the reviewer agent config).

---

### Codex CLI

If `directive.reviewer` is present, invoke the reviewer as a sub-agent (spawn the agent role named in `directive.reviewer` — the harness resolves its `.codex/agents/aidlc-<role>-agent.toml`, which loads its own persona via `developer_instructions`; do not inject it in the prompt).

---

### Cursor

If `directive.reviewer` is present, invoke the reviewer as a sub-agent (via the `task` tool targeting the reviewer agent).

---

### opencode

If `directive.reviewer` is present, invoke the reviewer as a sub-agent (via the `task` tool targeting the reviewer agent).

---

### GitHub Copilot

If `directive.reviewer` is present, invoke the reviewer as a sub-agent (delegate to the reviewer custom agent - the `.github/agents/` roster is exposed as callable agents).

# Market Research & Competitive Analysis

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Prior Context

- Read intent statement from `<record>/ideation/intent-capture/`
- Identify market-relevant aspects of the initiative

### Step 2: Generate Clarifying Questions

Create `<record>/ideation/market-research/market-research-questions.md` with questions:
- What competing products or solutions exist in the market?
- What are their strengths, weaknesses, and pricing models?
- What industry trends or regulatory shifts are relevant?
- What do customers expect as table-stakes vs. differentiators?
- For internal initiatives: are there existing tools, SaaS products, or open-source alternatives?
- What is the build-vs-buy-vs-partner calculus?
- What market size or addressable audience are we targeting?

Follow stage-protocol.md question flow (Guide Me / Edit File / Chat).

### Step 3: Collect and Analyze Answers

Run ambiguity detection and contradiction analysis on all answers.

### Step 4: Generate Artifacts

Create competitive analysis, market trends report, build-vs-buy assessment, and differentiation strategy brief based on answers and research.

### Step 5: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`aidlc engine orchestrate report --stage market-research --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 6: Present Completion & Request Approval

Review path: `<record>/ideation/market-research/`
Standard approval gate (Approve / Request Changes).

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under `<record>/ideation/market-research/`.

Imports: `required-sections`, `upstream-coverage`.

Upstream targets: `intent-statement`.

## Learn

When `directive.protocol_modules` lists `learnings`, follow
`stage-protocol-learnings.md`: keep the diary at `directive.memory_path` while
working and run the ritual before the approval gate, applying its bootstrap,
`single: true`, per-unit, and gate-revision exemptions. When the module is absent,
skip both the diary and the ritual.

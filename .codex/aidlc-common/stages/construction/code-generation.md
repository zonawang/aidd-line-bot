# Code Generation

## Steps

### Critical Rules

- Application code goes to workspace root, NEVER to the record dir
- Brownfield: modify files in-place. NEVER create duplicates like ClassName_modified.java
- Add data-testid attributes to interactive UI elements for test automation
- Before review, write `source-manifest.json` listing every application-source path this unit created, modified, or deleted, including shell-, scaffolding-, and generator-written files
- Measurable quality targets from NFR Requirements, NFR Design, and the Testing
  Contract coverage floor are inputs, not suggestions. NEVER relax, lower, or
  disable a defined target, including threshold settings in test or build
  configuration, to make a step pass; surface the gap instead.

### Step 1: Read All Unit Artifacts

Read all design artifacts for the current unit:
- Functional design from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/` (if exists)
- NFR requirements from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-requirements/` (if exists)
- NFR design from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-design/` (if exists)
- Infrastructure design from `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/` (if exists)
- Domain design (component catalogue) from `<record>/inception/domain-design/components.md` (if exists)
- Contracts from `<record>/inception/contract-design/contract-summary.md` (if exists)
- Unit definition from `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work.md` (if exists)
- Story map from `<record>/inception/units-generation/unit-of-work-story-map.md` (if exists)
- Requirements from `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md` (if exists)

Incremental scopes (bugfix, poc, refactor, security-patch) and the zero-Unit
`express` scope skip Units Generation by design. When those inputs are absent,
scope the work from Requirements Analysis and the workspace; on brownfield, also
use the reverse-engineered code knowledge base at
`aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`. Never invent the content of a
missing artifact.

For a zero-Unit directive (`directive.unit` absent and no Unit DAG), run exactly
one implementation iteration and write this stage's artifacts under
`<record>/construction/code-generation/` with no synthetic Unit segment. This is
ordinary stage work: no Bolt, walking-skeleton, ladder, per-Unit receipt, or
swarm ceremony applies.

For every later path in this stage, set `<code-generation-record>` from the
directive exactly once:

- `directive.unit` present:
  `<record>/construction/<directive.unit>/code-generation/`
- `directive.unit` absent:
  `<record>/construction/code-generation/`

### Step 2: PART 1 — Planning

Create a detailed code generation plan at
`<code-generation-record>/code-generation-plan.md` with checkboxes for each
implementation step. Include story-to-code-step traceability — map each plan
step back to the user story it implements.

Plan should cover (as applicable to the unit):
- [ ] Business logic implementation
- [ ] API/endpoint layer
- [ ] Repository/data access layer
- [ ] Database migrations/schema changes
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Configuration files
- [ ] Documentation (inline and API docs)
- [ ] Deployment artifacts (Dockerfiles, IaC)

**Test files are MANDATORY in the plan.** Consult the active test strategy (stage-protocol.md §8 "Test Strategy") to determine test scope and volume:
- **Minimal strategy**: Requirement-driven tests (1 per requirement, happy-path unit floor per component); unit tests are the default, but a `bugfix` / `security-patch` targeted regression uses the narrowest level that reproduces the defect
- **Standard strategy**: Unit test files per component (5-8 tests each) + integration test stubs for key boundaries
- **Comprehensive strategy**: Unit + integration + E2E test files per component (10-15 tests each)

Apply the active scope's floor additively:
- `mvp`, `enterprise`, `feature`, `infra`: the selected strategy plus 80% line coverage and CI execution before merge.
- `bugfix`, `security-patch`: the selected strategy plus a targeted regression for the bug/vulnerability at the narrowest level that reproduces it, even when that adds one integration/E2E test beyond Minimal's unit-test default; the existing suite remains green.
- `poc`, `refactor`, `workshop`: the selected strategy still applies; the scope adds no extra new-test floor, and the existing suite remains green.

The selected strategy and scope floor are both obligations. Neither replaces the other.

The plan MUST include steps for:
- [ ] Test files appropriate to the active test strategy
- [ ] Test configuration (vitest.config, jest.config, or equivalent)

If the plan presented to the user omits test file steps, add them before presenting. Tests are not deferred to Build and Test — that stage verifies and extends, not creates from scratch.

**Test ordering follows one deterministic Testing Contract.** Run:

```bash
aidlc engine testing-posture render
```

Paste the command's complete `## Testing Contract` JSON block into `code-generation-plan.md` unchanged. The resolver reads all `## Testing Posture` sections additively and selects the narrowest explicit methodology/order statement; coverage, tooling, integration, or scope notes remain applicable but cannot erase a broader methodology. A contradictory narrower methodology is an error, not an override: halt and ask for the memory rule to be revised.

Use the contract's `plan_profile.steps` as the required ordering baseline, adapting names and omitting genuinely inapplicable layers without changing the methodology:
- **TDD**: for every applicable testable layer — data-model/database behavior, repository/data access, business logic, API/endpoint, and frontend behavior — plan Red (failing tests), Green (minimal implementation), then Refactor while green.
- **BDD**: define executable behavior/scenario examples before each observable feature slice, implement that slice across every required layer, run scenarios green, then refactor. Do not turn BDD into layer-local TDD.
- **ATDD**: write executable acceptance tests before the complete cross-layer feature implementation, implement against that acceptance contract, run acceptance green, then refactor. Do not split acceptance intent into unrelated per-layer Red steps.
- **Custom/mixed**: preserve the contract's exact `ordering` text, such as scenario-first BDD with lower-level unit tests after implementation. Never coerce a mixed posture into TDD.
- **Test-after**: for every applicable testable layer, implement the layer and then write/run that layer's tests.

The contract always puts test-runner readiness before the first executable test step. On greenfield work, bootstrap the minimal runner/configuration and dependency needed to execute the exact unit-scoped command before the first TDD Red, BDD scenario, or ATDD acceptance step. On brownfield work, verify that command before the first test-first step. Record the exact command in `unit-test-instructions.md`; a Red/Green step is invalid if no runnable command exists.

Number each plan step sequentially (Step 1, Step 2, etc.) for clear execution ordering and traceability. Preserve dependency ordering inside the selected methodology, and deviate only when the architecture requires it (for example, event-driven systems or independently deployable services).

Also create
`<code-generation-record>/unit-test-instructions.md`
before Plan Approval. Consult the active test strategy (stage-protocol.md §8
"Test Strategy") and use the matching unit-test scope:

- **Minimal strategy**: Requirement-driven unit tests (1 test per requirement,
  happy-path floor per component), approximately 5-15 tests total
- **Standard strategy**: 5-8 tests per component, with key behavior coverage
- **Comprehensive strategy**: 10-15 tests per component, with thorough coverage

Scope floors remain additive here: a Minimal `bugfix` / `security-patch` still
includes its targeted regression at the narrowest level that reproduces the
defect.

Include:
- Test framework setup and configuration
- How to run THIS UNIT's tests, including the exact command that is runnable before the first test-first cycle
- Expected coverage targets
- Mocking/stubbing guidance
- Test data management

Every run command in this file MUST be scoped to this unit only, using exact
test file paths or an exact unit filter. A bare project-wide command like
`npm test` is not acceptable. Build and Test executes every unit's commands,
so an unscoped command would rerun the whole suite once per unit.

Present a summary of the unit test instructions together with the plan summary
to the user.

### Step 3: Plan Approval

Before presenting the approval, create or update
`<code-generation-record>/code-generation-questions.md`
with a **Plan Approval** question that covers both
`code-generation-plan.md`, its embedded Testing Contract, and
`unit-test-instructions.md`. When reapproval is required, reset the existing
Plan Approval `[Answer]:` to blank before regenerating anything. After both
files are final, run:

Run the unit-bound form when `directive.unit` is present:

```bash
aidlc engine testing-posture fingerprint --unit "<directive.unit>"
```

For a zero-Unit directive, use the explicit `--stage-level` target; the tool then resolves the stage-level
`<record>/construction/code-generation/` evidence:

```bash
aidlc engine testing-posture fingerprint --stage-level
```

The command prints two copy-ready tag lines. Write BOTH into the Plan Approval
section verbatim, followed by both options below and a blank `[Answer]:` tag:

```
[Approval Fingerprint]: sha256:v3:<hex>
[Planned Source]: <hex or the word unbindable>
```

- "Approve Plan" — proceed to code generation
- "Request Changes" — revise the plan

`[Approval Fingerprint]` is the content binding. It covers a stable projection
of the plan, the unit test instructions byte for byte, the embedded Testing
Contract hash, the target, the intent, and the current stage attempt. The plan
projection erases exactly two things: ticked list task markers (`[x]`, `[X]`,
`[-]` all read as `[ ]`), the one edit this stage itself orders after approval,
and a terminal `## Review` appendix, which a review recorded before review
records existed may have left in the plan (the reviewer writes its review to a
record now, so nothing new is appended). It also normalizes line endings,
per-line trailing whitespace, and runs of blank lines. Everything else in the
plan is byte-exact, including the fenced Testing Contract JSON and any text
inside code fences, so rewording a step, reordering steps, or changing a number,
a path, or the contract hash changes the content binding. The unit test
instructions get no projection at all beyond line endings: they are handed to the developer in
full, so any byte added to them after approval, a `## Review` section included,
changes that binding too.

**After approval, respect the effective plan-approval fence.** For the same
intent, target, and stage attempt, edits to the plan, unit test instructions, or
Testing Contract require reapproval when that fence is on (`strict` by default, or
explicit `guard.plan-approval on`). When it is lowered by `relaxed`, `off`, or
`guard.plan-approval off`, continue with the updated content through the engine;
do not reset `[Answer]:`, re-fingerprint the approval, or ask for approval again
solely because that content changed. Relay any continuation notice once. Keep
the original human answer and approval evidence as the record of the earlier
content; continuation does not mean the edited content was approved. Never
fabricate a new answer or receipt. The human can still request another review
of the plan. Initial Plan Approval and all other gates remain required.

The same rule applies when Testing Posture, scope, test strategy, or project
type inputs change. Refresh the current Testing Contract and instructions as
needed, then continue with those well-formed artifacts if the fence remains
lowered. The context change alone does not require a new approval or allow the
earlier approval to be relabelled as covering the updated content.

When checking whether to continue, use `testing-posture verify --unit
"<directive.unit>"` (or `--stage-level`) and its `execution_allowed` field.
`execution_allowed: true` with exit 0 permits continuation even when `ok: false`
reports that the current content is not approved. In that case, `reason` gives
the user-facing continuation message; `approval_reason` retains the stale
binding detail for diagnosis. Do not turn that diagnostic into a refusal or a
new approval question. `begin` and `brief` honor the
same permission; a continuation brief labels its content `Current plan` and
`Current unit-test instructions`, not `Approved`. A nonempty plan, test
instructions, and a well-formed Testing Contract are still needed to execute.
Repair missing artifacts or malformed contract JSON using the tool's error;
that repair is not by itself a new approval ceremony.

Delegated workers use the live plan-approval fence of their verified parent
intent. Lowering or raising that fence applies to existing workers at the next
check; use the tool's result rather than a copied worker setting.

`[Planned Source]` is the workspace source this plan was written against. What
happens when live source has moved since is decided by the intent's Guard
Policy value (`/aidlc --status` shows it). Under `strict` the decision and
answer commands refuse, telling the human which files changed, and the remedy
is always the same: re-run this command, record both tags again, and re-present
the plan. Under `relaxed` and `off` they continue: the change is recorded once as a
`CHANGE_ACCEPTED` row, the command's JSON carries one `change_notices` line for
the human (say it verbatim, once), and the recorded source is re-baselined so
the same change is not reported again. The human can still say "review the
plan again", which is this same re-run and re-present path. A tag recorded in
an older form (`sha256:<hex>` or `sha256:v2:<hex>`) is recognized and answered
with the same instruction rather than an unexplained mismatch. Content edits
follow the effective-fence rule above; the source-drift record does not grant
approval to edited content.

When the active directive carries `legacy_plan_approval_choices`, those two
nonce-labelled values are the presentation-only choices for legacy Kiro IDE.
Present them exactly and never write them into the questions file, audit, plan,
instructions, or any other shared artifact. Map the selected protected label
back to canonical `Approve Plan` or `Request Changes` for `[Answer]:`,
`--details`, and all subsequent lifecycle logic.

Before presenting, record the exact prompt identity:

```bash
aidlc engine log decision --stage code-generation \
  --checkpoint plan-approval \
  --session "<Runtime Session from SessionStart context>" \
  --questions-file "<code-generation-record>/code-generation-questions.md" \
  --decision "Approve this exact Code Generation plan?" \
  --options "Approve Plan,Request Changes" \
  --unit "<directive.unit>"
```

For zero-Unit work replace `--unit "<directive.unit>"` with `--stage-level`.
The command prints `{"emitted":"DECISION_RECORDED",...,"challengeId":"<id>",
"challengeFile":"<path>"}`: the challenge the human's answer will be paired
with. Run `decision` exactly once per presentation. Re-running it after the
human has already answered replaces the challenge and orphans that answer, and
the receipt then refuses. When the workspace source cannot be bound, `decision`
refuses before minting anything and prints its remedies in order (repair the
source boundary and re-run the fingerprint command first, the human-only
break-glass exit last); relay them as printed. When it refuses with `hooks are
not firing in this session`, the hooks that record the human's answer are not
running: relay its recovery text and stop; do not re-run `decision` until the
harness has been restarted with hooks enabled.
Then present the structured question and STOP the turn. Fill `[Answer]:` only
after the human explicitly responds, using the exact unlettered choice
`Approve Plan` or `Request Changes`, then immediately run the matching receipt:

```bash
aidlc engine log answer --stage code-generation \
  --checkpoint plan-approval \
  --session "<same Runtime Session>" \
  --questions-file "<code-generation-record>/code-generation-questions.md" \
  --details "<exact choice>" \
  --unit "<directive.unit>"
```

Again use `--stage-level` instead of `--unit` for zero-Unit work. The markdown
answer and `PLAN_APPROVAL_RECORDED` audit row are context/provenance only.
Initial generation remains blocked until this command consumes the protected
session-bound challenge/response and writes its runtime receipt under
`aidlc/.aidlc-sessions/plan-approval/`. That receipt binds the human's choice to
the exact plan, instructions, and Testing Contract content, to the target, and to
the current stage attempt. A conductor-authored answer or forged audit row cannot
create that authority.

When the receipt command is refused, relay the engine's remedy list to the human
in the order the engine prints it: repair remedies first (repair the source
boundary, re-run the fingerprint command, re-present the plan), and the
break-glass exit last. The break-glass exit is human-only. Never propose it,
never initiate it, and never run it on your own judgement. Only after the human
has TYPED exactly `Override Plan Approval: <reason>` as a chat prompt (the
human-turn hook records that typed text; a picked option does not count) run the
same receipt command once more with `--override "<their reason, verbatim>"`. The
engine checks the typed request for this session against the reason, records
`PLAN_APPROVAL_OVERRIDDEN` with the checks it overrode, and writes a receipt bound
to plan content and stage attempt only. The override is recorded, single-use, and
never inferred; if the normal receipt succeeds, nothing is overridden.

On "Request Changes", record that choice through the same answer command, revise
the plan and unit test instructions as needed, reset `[Answer]:` to blank,
regenerate the Testing Contract and fingerprint, record a fresh decision, and
present the question again. Postapproval plan, instruction, and Testing Contract
edits, including updates after Testing Posture, scope, strategy, or project type
changes, follow the effective-fence rule above. A different intent or target,
or a new stage attempt (a jump, a rejection, or a workflow restart), still
requires its own actual Plan Approval; a lowered fence cannot supply missing
initial approval.
Re-running `next`, a Stop-hook probe, a status query, or a reissued directive for
the same target and attempt does NOT reopen it: approval binds to content and
attempt, never to which directive asked the question. Before initial approval,
do not begin Step 4 or dispatch the developer agent. A forwarding-loop
continuation never supplies approval. After approval, a lowered fence permits
the content-change continuation above without replacing the original receipt.

> (`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md`) defines this replay.

> code-generation directive, and run the full decision/human-turn/answer receipt
> sequence again. The earlier "Retry with fix" choice authorizes the jump; it
> does not mint approval for plan content the human has not yet reviewed under
> the new attempt.

### Step 4: PART 2 — Generation

Before delegating, display to the user:
"Generating code for [N] plan steps. This may take several minutes depending on project complexity. I'll show a summary when complete."

Delegate to Task tool with subagent_type="aidlc-developer-agent".

The aidlc-developer-agent persona and its knowledge are loaded automatically by the named agent. Do NOT manually inject the persona in the prompt.

Include in the delegation prompt:
- First, verbatim and unedited, the output of
  `aidlc engine testing-posture brief --unit
  <directive.unit>` (or `--stage-level` for a zero-Unit directive). Its first
  line is the exact target marker (`AIDLC-UNIT: <directive.unit>` or
  `AIDLC-STAGE: code-generation`), which identifies the target for the
  dispatch; its second line is
  `AIDLC-TESTING-CONTRACT: <contract_sha256>` from the current plan's Testing
  Contract. With its fence on, the plan-approval guard rejects a missing,
  different, or stale hash. Do not write either marker yourself and do not repeat either marker
  for contextual dependencies.
- Design artifacts for the CURRENT UNIT ONLY (not all units)
- A 1-2 line summary of each inception-phase artifact with its file path (requirements summary, stories summary, app design summary) — the subagent can Read specific files if it needs full content
- The current plan and unit-test-instructions.md are already in that output:
  the plan with a terminal `## Review` appendix removed (when a review recorded under the
  earlier protocol left one), task markers reset to `[ ]`, and spacing
  normalized; the instructions byte for byte. The plan is also this stage's
  review artifact; the review itself lives in its record, not in the plan. Only
  what was fingerprinted was approved. After a permitted content-change
  continuation, use the updated brief without describing the edits as approved.
  The excluded appendix is never work to execute. With its fence on, the
  plan-approval guard refuses a handoff that quotes it. Do not read the
  plan file into the prompt yourself; the subagent ticks its progress in the
  plan file, not in the prompt
- Project workspace details (languages, frameworks, conventions from aidlc-state.md)
- Instructions to execute each plan step sequentially and mark checkboxes as
  completed. Task markers are excluded from the approval fingerprint, so ticking
  a box never changes the content binding; other edits follow Step 3's
  effective-fence rule
- The instruction that the current Testing Contract in the tool-produced brief is
  authoritative for Part 2. The subagent must not independently re-resolve or
  reinterpret memory. TDD records each Red command's failing output before
  Green; BDD and ATDD follow their scenario/acceptance-first cross-layer
  profiles; custom/mixed follows the exact ordering in that contract.
- The instruction that measurable quality targets from NFR Requirements, NFR
  Design, and the Testing Contract coverage floor are inputs, not suggestions.
  The subagent must NEVER relax, lower, or disable a defined target, including
  threshold settings in test or build configuration, to make a step pass; it
  must surface the gap instead.

The subagent generates all code, test files, and configuration artifacts in the workspace.

### Step 5: Generate Code Summary

After subagent completes, create `<code-generation-record>/code-summary.md`
documenting:
- Files created/modified
- Key implementation decisions
- Test coverage summary
- Any deviations from the plan

Create `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/code-generation/source-manifest.json`
with this strict schema:

```json
{
  "stage": "code-generation",
  "unit": "u1-auth",
  "version": 1,
  "writes": [
    { "path": "src/auth/login.ts" },
    { "path": "src/auth/generated/" },
    { "repo": "repo-a", "path": "src/api/routes.ts" }
  ]
}
```

List every application-source path this unit created, modified, or deleted,
including files written by shell commands, scaffolding, or generators. Use a
trailing `/` directory claim for generated trees. In the main workspace,
multi-repo entries name their recorded `repo`; inside the worktree hosting the Bolt, paths are
relative to its single selected repo and MUST omit `repo`. The engine refuses
to record the unit review without this manifest, and unclaimed changed paths
block stage completion.

Create
`<code-generation-record>/traceability.json`.
Enumerate every assigned AC, detailed `NFRx.y`, and `BRx.y` (or direct `FR` /
`NFR` IDs when incremental scope skipped the design chain). Every `OK` target
must be one existing workspace-relative implementation or test file:

```json
{
  "stage": "code-generation",
  "unit": "u1-auth",
  "upstream_ids": ["AC1.1.1", "NFR1.1", "BR1.1"],
  "coverage": [
    { "id": "AC1.1.1", "status": "OK", "target": "src/auth/login.ts" },
    { "id": "NFR1.1", "status": "OK", "target": "src/cache/redis.ts" },
    { "id": "BR1.1", "status": "OK", "target": "src/auth/policy.ts" }
  ]
}
```

### Step 6: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`aidlc engine orchestrate report --stage code-generation --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 7: Completion

Present completion message and approval gate:

```
# :computer: Code Generation Complete — {unit-name}
```

Summary of code produced (files, tests, key decisions), then:

```
**Review:** `<code-generation-record>/`
```

Approval gate: strictly 2-option (Approve / Request Changes).

> **Note - orchestrator-managed completion gating.** Initial Step 3 Plan Approval is a mandatory hard stop in every execution mode, including during Construction: generation must never begin before the human chooses "Approve Plan". The stop is the conductor's obligation even when the plan-approval fence is lowered. After that approval, content edits for the same target and attempt follow Step 3's effective-fence rule: a lowered fence permits continuation without another approval stop. The Build-and-Test loop-back replay described above opens a new stage attempt and therefore re-runs Plan Approval on the repaired plan, rather than inferring approval from the "Retry with fix" choice. Only the Step 7 completion approval gate is suppressed by the orchestrator during normal Construction. On the default stage-major walk a single stage-level gate covers every Unit after the last Unit settles. Under an autonomous swarm the engine presents that Code Generation stage gate only after the final DAG batch has converged (intermediate batches merge without a gate). The completion gate still exists here for direct-invocation use (e.g., `/aidlc --stage code-generation` re-running a single Unit), and subagents invoked via Task must NOT invoke that completion gate themselves - the orchestrator owns completion-gate presentation.

## Sensors

This stage produces TypeScript/JavaScript code in the active Bolt
worktree. Generated code lives at the workspace root (NEVER under
the record dir); the planning, plan-approval, and summary artefacts
(`code-generation-plan.md`, `code-generation-questions.md`,
`unit-test-instructions.md`, `code-summary.md`) live under
`<code-generation-record>/`.

Imports: `required-sections`, `linter`, `type-check`, `traceability`.

`required-sections` checks each planning and summary artefact for at least two
H2 headings. `linter` and `type-check` run against matching generated code,
and `traceability` verifies the per-Unit coverage table and every `OK` target.

`upstream-coverage` is intentionally NOT imported because the stage consumes a
broad, scope-dependent design set. `source-manifest.json` is
engine-validated against its strict schema and source binding, while
`traceability.json` is owned by the `traceability` sensor; neither structured
file is subject to the `required-sections` floor.

## Learn

When `directive.protocol_modules` lists `learnings`, follow
`stage-protocol-learnings.md`: keep the diary at `directive.memory_path` while
working and run the ritual before the approval gate, applying its bootstrap,
`single: true`, per-unit, and gate-revision exemptions. When the module is absent,
skip both the diary and the ritual.

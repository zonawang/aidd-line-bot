// Deterministic Testing Posture contract for Code Generation.
//
// Practices remain human-authored prose, but code generation needs one stable
// execution contract. This module resolves methodology independently from
// coverage/tooling notes, builds a methodology-specific plan profile, binds the
// result to the active scope/test strategy/project type, and fingerprints the
// approved plan + unit test instructions. Both the dispatch guard and autonomous
// swarm referee consume the same contract.

// --- The Plan Approval content projection -------------------------------------
//
// The approval must survive the edit the stage itself ORDERS after approval, and
// must not survive an edit to the plan. Byte-exact hashing cannot do both: Step 4
// tells the developer agent to tick the plan's checkboxes as it works, so hashing
// raw bytes invalidated every approval as soon as the approved work started.
//
// So the fingerprint is taken over a projection that erases exactly these
// mutations and nothing else:
//
//   1. A TERMINAL `## Review` appendix is removed, using the engine's own
//      appendix locator (a `## Review` inside a fence or an HTML comment, a
//      lower-case or unspaced variant, and a mid-plan section are all NOT an
//      appendix and stay material). This is a legacy-compatibility step: the
//      reviewer used to append its verdict to the plan because the plan is the
//      stage's review artifact. Reviews live in review records now and nothing
//      appends to the plan, but a plan reviewed under the earlier protocol may
//      still carry that section, and its approval must not depend on it.
//   2. List task markers are reset: `[x]`, `[X]` and `[-]` become `[ ]`, outside
//      fenced blocks and HTML comments. A tick is a claim about execution, not a
//      change to the plan.
//   3. Line endings become LF, trailing whitespace per line is dropped OUTSIDE
//      fences, runs of blank lines outside fences and comments collapse to one, and
//      trailing blank lines are dropped. These are editor artifacts, not content.
//      Inside a fence every byte is kept, because there a whitespace-only line can
//      be the difference between two patches.
//
// Everything else is byte-exact, INCLUDING the fenced `## Testing Contract` JSON
// and any text inside code fences. Reordering, rewording, adding or deleting a
// step, changing a number, a path, or the contract hash all change the
// projection.
//
// The one thing the projection cannot see is an edit made INSIDE a terminal
// review appendix. That is closed elsewhere: the worker brief carries the plan
// BODY (this projection's input), produced by the `brief` command and checked by
// the dispatch guard, so a step smuggled into the appendix is never delivered as
// work.
//
// This projection is for the PLAN only. The unit-test instructions are not a
// review artifact and have no mandated post-approval mutation, so they bind
// byte-exactly (line endings aside): see `projectInstructionsContent`.

// aidlc-attest.ts — Commit-level provenance: content-derived attribution from
// git commits/diffs back to reviewed units of work, plus enrichment anchors.
//
// Two verbs:
//   resolve — READ-ONLY reverse lookup: which reviewed unit owns each changed
//     path of a diff/commit, and does the committed content match what the
//     reviewer approved? Attribution is a pure function of repository content:
//     REVIEW_COMPLETED receipts (audit shards) carry a Unit Source Fingerprint
//     that is the sha256 of the evidence file
//     construction/<unit>/<stage>/reviewed-source-<hash12>.tsv (manifest header
//     + claim-restricted path→OID listing). No commit hooks, no commit-message
//     trailers, no pushed refs are consulted, so a bare clone resolves manual
//     commits exactly as well as tool-made ones.
//   anchor — append SOURCE_COMMITTED audit events recording that a commit was
//     observed to land reviewed claims. Enrichment ONLY: resolve never reads
//     anchors, so a commit that was never anchored still resolves.
//
// WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. resolve answers an INTEGRITY question:
// do the bytes that landed equal the bytes some receipt in the record approved?
// It does NOT answer an AUTHENTICITY question: was that receipt produced by a
// review that actually happened? Receipts, manifests, and evidence are ordinary
// files in the repository, so anyone who can write to the repository can write a
// receipt — including in the same change set as the source it approves. A report
// is therefore informational unless the caller supplies a trust anchor that the
// author of the change cannot forge. Two are available here:
//   --record-ref <ref>       read the record from a ref the verifier controls
//                            (a protected branch, a records-only ref) instead of
//                            from the commit under test
//   --require-trust signed   demand that every input the verdict rests on — each
//                            relied-upon receipt shard AND the evidence file it
//                            selects — arrived in a signed commit
// `trust` in the report always states which anchor was actually in force, so a
// report can never look stronger than the evidence behind it. The full threat
// model — assets, adversaries, and the guarantee boundary — is
// docs/reference/20-commit-provenance.md §2.
//
// DETERMINISM. The record is read from a git tree, not from the checkout: by
// default the queried head's tree, or `--record-ref`'s. So the same (base, head)
// pair resolves identically in every clone and at every later date, which is the
// property that makes a stored report meaningful. The working tree is read only
// when the record provably cannot live in the queried repository (a multi-root
// workspace whose roof is not the repo), and `trust.recordSource` says so.
//
// Path statuses:
//   verified      reviewed state equals head state for the path (same entry,
//                 or absent on both sides) under the owning unit's newest
//                 READY receipt
//   drifted       covered by a reviewed claim but head differs from reviewed
//   unattested    no unit's claims cover the path
//   unverifiable  covered, but the receipt or its evidence cannot bind content
//                 (unbindable fingerprint, or missing/hash-mismatched bytes in
//                 the record source being read)
//   indeterminate covered, but two same-timestamp READY receipts make "newest"
//                 causally unordered — in different shards, or in different
//                 records claiming the same path (fail closed both ways)
//   excluded      framework shell/record path (aidlc/, .aidlc/, sensor dirs, and
//                 the harness shell dirs established by the range's BASE tree —
//                 read from the commit, so the same SHA excludes the same paths
//                 everywhere without letting a change declare its own exclusion)
//
// Report `warnings` name conditions that can distort a report without changing
// any single path's classification — today repository byte-form conversion, and
// a fallback to working-tree records.

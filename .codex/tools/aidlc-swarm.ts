// Swarm convergence referee — the deterministic verdict surface the conductor consults.
//
// The swarm follows the recorded Construction execution policy inside a live
// harness session. That session — the conductor — owns the fan-out (N parallel
// Task calls, or an inline Dynamic Workflow when AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1) and the retry
// loop. A bun subprocess cannot issue Task calls, so the worker-dispatch layer is
// NOT here. What lives here is everything that must be deterministic: the
// convergence verdict, the anti-tamper guard, the serialised merge-back, the audit
// taxonomy, and the typed failure envelope.
//
// THE SPLIT (three concerns): the conductor owns fan-out + loop drive (knowledge);
// this tool owns the convergence verdict + merge + audit (determinism); the human
// grants autonomy and takes the baton on the envelope (judgement).
//
// THREE SUBCOMMANDS (no retry counter or retry cap):
//   prepare  --batch <n> --units <a,b,c> [--base <branch>] [--concurrency <n>]
//            [--degraded-from <subagent|ultracode>] [--repo <name>] [--resume-existing]
//       Fork an isolated git worktree per unit (aidlc-worktree create +
//       aidlc-bolt start --worktree) and emit SWARM_STARTED once for the units
//       whose worktrees were successfully prepared.
//       --repo (P7) selects the sibling repo the batch's worktrees fork inside (a
//       multi-repo intent requires it; single-repo infers the lone repo); the
//       resolved name is forwarded to every aidlc-worktree create + bolt start.
//       The anti-tamper baseline is each worktree's OWN git fork (HEAD) — nothing
//       is stored; check/finalize re-derive the pristine bytes with `git diff
//       --quiet HEAD`. Runs before any worker, so it cannot fold into check.
//       --degraded-from records a loud downgrade (AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1 but the
//       Workflow tool was unavailable, so the conductor ran the subagent floor):
//       emits SWARM_DEGRADED. The driver-SELECTION read (AIDLC_USE_SWARM) is
//       conductor-side — this tool only learns a degrade happened via the flag.
//       --resume-existing resumes a current swarm-batch Request Changes. It
//       preserves surviving source/history and archives framework records, or
//       creates a new child when native source landing removed the old one.
//       Both paths require current Plan Approval or a protected continuation
//       under a lowered plan-approval fence before dispatch.
//   check <unit> [--check-cmd <cmd>] [--test-file <path>]
//       Stateless single-unit verdict: the authorized Construction Verification
//       Command under checkpoints; a required --check-cmd under legacy autonomy
//       (exit 0 = green,
//       the AUTHORITATIVE signal — a worker's own success claim is never trusted)
//       plus an anti-tamper compare of the protected file against its forked-git
//       baseline. Prints {unit, converged, tampered, reason}; exits 0 iff the unit
//       is GENUINELY converged (green AND untampered), non-zero otherwise. Emits
//       no audit — it informs the conductor's retry decision (knowledge), it does
//       not commit anything. Same input → same verdict, however many times called.
//   finalize --batch <n> --units <a,b,c> --claimed <a,b> [--check-cmd <cmd>]
//            [--test-file <path>] [--reasons <unit>=<reason>,...]
//       The AUTHORITATIVE gate. The conductor's claimed-converged set is an
//       explicit input and the only thing finalize trusts from it. For each
//       claimed unit, RE-RUN the check (green + untampered) and, when the current
//       stage declares a reviewer, require that unit's matching post-BOLT_STARTED
//       REVIEW_COMPLETED receipt before any merge. A unit named in --claimed but
//       red or unreviewed on disk is refused the merge and lands in the failure
//       envelope (the lying-conductor guard). Serialised HOLD-MERGE merge-back of
//       the genuine passes only, then emit the full SWARM_* audit trail + the typed
//       envelope + exit 0/2. --reasons carries the conductor's
//       typed attribution for a DECLINED (unclaimed) unit — unsatisfiable /
//       budget-exhausted / cap-exhausted — recorded faithfully (the conductor
//       judges WHY a unit gave up; the tool only records it, never for a claimed
//       unit, whose reason is always the tool's own re-verify verdict).
//
// WHY STATELESS / NO CAP CONSTANT. "The cap" is three jobs on three concerns — the
// verdict (determinism -> check), the retry decision (knowledge -> the conductor,
// which judges "one more try vs unsatisfiable"), and the runaway backstop
// (determinism -> the harness 8-block Stop-hook ceiling). A per-unit counter here
// would make determinism do the knowledge job and is redundant on the other
// drivers (the ultracode script's cap is its `for`-bound; /goal's is its
// turn-clause). So this tool holds none of it: check is advisory, finalize is
// authoritative (re-verifies at the merge gate), so a red unit cannot merge even
// if the conductor lies or misremembers.
//
// COMPOSES existing tools, does NOT reimplement them:
//   - aidlc-worktree create        -> the isolated git worktree per unit
//   - aidlc-bolt start --worktree  -> state/audit/runtime-graph fork into it
//   - aidlc-bolt complete --merge  -> the AIDLC-data merge back to the base
//   - aidlc-bolt release-merge     -> release the existing per-Bolt HOLD-MERGE
//     lock before a serialised merge (idempotent — safe if never held). The merge
//     phase is serial (a one-at-a-time loop), so only one merge is ever in flight.
//   - aidlc-bolt fail              -> close a failed unit's Bolt lifecycle
//     (BOLT_FAILED paired with the BOLT_STARTED that `start --worktree` emitted).
